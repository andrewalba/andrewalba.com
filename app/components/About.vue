        <p class="mb-4">Over the past decade, I’ve undergone a journey of growth and transformation, shaped by wise influences, intense debates, and moments of both joy and sorrow. Each season of my life has contributed to the person I am today—a student, an athlete, a husband, and a father. While my earlier choices often leaned toward selfishness and immaturity, a steadfast sense of truth and honor guided me, even when I faltered.</p>
        <p class="mb-4">A pivotal turning point came when my family and I found solace and belonging in worship. The fellowship and simple yet profound messages reminded us of the church’s mantra: <em>“Timeless Truth in a Timely Way.”</em> This season of renewal inspired me to strive toward becoming a better husband, father, and person.</p>
        <p>In October 2019, I took another significant step by committing to a healthier lifestyle. This journey toward fitness not only improved my physical well-being but also became a catalyst for deep self-reflection. Today, I am guided by the virtues of wisdom, justice, courage, and moderation. Sharing my journey is both a personal endeavor and a way to stay accountable, inviting others to join me in the pursuit of a better self.</p>
