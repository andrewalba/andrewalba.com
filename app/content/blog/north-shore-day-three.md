Our final full day on the North Shore started off wet and breezy. We spent the morning catching up and sipping copious 
amounts of coffee. Pauline suggested a late breakfast to get the day started. She made us chorizo, eggs and hash browns 
with warm tortillas. The meal was filling and would haunt me later climbing the hills at Temperance River State Park.

We left just before noon, the rain seemingly to finish about the same time we arrived at the park. We loaded up our 
gear and harnessed the dogs and went on our way. The dogs forgot how to walk with us for a third straight day in a row. 
We didn't get far before we were on slick brown lava lock peering over the edge trying to get a glimpse of he hidden 
falls at the bottom of the Temperance River gorge.

The steps wet and slick in appearance, were a bit much to handle with two large dogs pulling in all directions. Taking 
our time we hiked the short distance to the first set of falls. The clouds were still blanketing the sun making the 
light shallow. The cascades of the river were difficult to photograph as the gorge was narrow. Pauline had some 
anxiety with the wet rock, so we were quick to get on the trail and move north.

As we moved north, the river widened, so we spent some time hunting for agates. The problem being that neither of us 
know what an agate looks like. It didn't matter as we enjoyed poking around the shore while the dogs enjoyed splashing 
in the river.

We moved further north to the next set of falls. They were also hidden from the trail. Pauline allowed me to roam closer 
to the river to get some better photos and video. It was time well spent taking photos and trying to enjoy the sights 
and sounds the river was providing. We met back up along the trail and continued on the hiking club trail. The password 
was not far from the falls at the top of the trail.

We continued on the hiking trail, enjoying the white and silver birch and aspen. Only a few still were holding on to 
their leaves. The trail was wider and smoother most of the way back to the gorge. Once we arrived back at the gorge, we 
tried to take advantage of the mid day sun which was now shinning bright between passing clouds.

We walked a short way onto the volcanic rock, near the river and spent some time relaxing to the sound of the 
water and air churning into a frothy foam. Even with the warm sun, the breeze and moisture gave me a chill. We hit 
the trail once again taking our time down the steep rock stairs that still had a pattering of water on them.

Once we arrived back at the vehicle, I was done. Belle had done her best to frustrate me. Her plan worked. I wanted 
nothing to do with the dogs at that point and was happy to head back to the camper to drink a beer and try to reflect 
on the great hiking and views and less about a dog that thinks she is a tank.

Once we arrived back at the camp site, my day didn't get much better. Pauline took a hike by herself to the lake, while
I stayed by the camper to relax. While looking over my photographs, I realized my rear was getting colder by the moment.
The seat of my chair was damp, with the passing breeze causing a chill. Having enough of this cold, I decided to move 
into the camper only to first step into some fresh dog droppings. YOU WIN CRUEL WORLD, I SURRENDER!

Pauline returned and found me sulking near the camper. We made plans for the evening which included a stop back at the 
shore line to watch the sunset. We hiked to the lake and arrived with plenty of time to enjoy the crashing water into 
black rocky shore line. The sun drifted behind the pines to the west, while we used our phones to capture every moment 
that we could. After watching the sun fade behind the horizon, we just sat quietly enjoying the sounds and sights that
Lake Superior had to offer for October in the year of 2020.

We came back to the camp site and Pauline started a fire while I started the grill for our squash and rib-eye. Pauline 
prepped the salad, while I unsealed the growler of beer. Maybe we were famished, but our meal was delicious. We headed 
back to the fire, burning all the wood we had left. Hours passed as we fed the fire and conversation. In the end, we had 
only burning embers and our hands and feet were cold, knees sore from all the walking. We came inside to finish the 
night with some beer and banana bread. Our trip almost completed, we had already started talking about the next trip to 
the North Shore.
