For many seasons of my life, I supported a conservative agenda. While proclaiming to be a man of faith and conservative
values, my actions were everything but those of a true conservative. I let others explain the contents of the bible
instead of guiding myself through the good book. Instead of saving money, it was spent foolishly on pleasures. I failed
to give my family the time and support they needed.

I believed in hard work and "trickle-down economics". The myth that if you work hard, you would succeed. Growing up
with a low-income, marrying, and having a family with a low-income, my wife and I took pride in our success.

A decade ago, I began to question my belief about financial wealth. My financial situation had improved dramatically
within a short period. I realized that financial wealth can provide amenities, pleasures, and a sense of security. Does
financial wealth provide happiness though?

Fast-forward to four years ago when this country decides to elect a man who dubiously claims to be financially
successful. Many right-leaning and Christian family and friends are endorsing this man and his agenda. A nationalistic
agenda, policies that are unabashedly in favor of the wealthy, and rhetoric that is contrary to the Christian character.

Revisiting the same questions about financial wealth and happiness from a decade ago, new questions began to emerge.
Article after article began detailing how the pandemic of 2020 has deepened the financial abyss between the wealthy and
the poor. We are approaching one year of fear and uncertainty for so many, yet many Christians are still supporting
policies that protect the fortunes of the wealthy. Fortunes magnified by a pandemic that is eating away at the savings
and income of so many average Americans.

So why as Christians should we be willing to give favor to *the rich*? Better question... what does the bible tell us
in regard to those who are wealthy?

> No one can serve two masters. Either you will hate the one and love the other, or you will be devoted to
the one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.
>
> \- <cite>Matthew 6:24</cite>

> Keep your lives free from the love of money and be content with what you have, because God has said,
'Never will I leave you; never will I forsake you.'
> 
> \- <cite>Hebrews 13:5</cite>

This is one of my favorites. I mentally picture a silly cartoon depicting [this act](http://www.reverendfun.com/toon/20070110/).

> Indeed, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter
the kingdom of God.
> 
> \- <cite>Luke 18:25</cite>

> Command those who are rich in this present world not to be arrogant nor to put their hope in wealth,
which is so uncertain, but to put their hope in God, who richly provides us with everything for our enjoyment. Command
them to do good, to be rich in good deeds, and to be generous and willing to share.
> 
> \- <cite>1 Timothy 6:17-18</cite>

> For the sun rises with scorching heat and withers the plant; its blossom falls and its beauty is
destroyed. In the same way, the rich will fade away even while they go about their business.
> 
> \- <cite>James 1:11</cite>

### Don't Be Hatin'

Reading the above, you might believe being rich is evil. That is not my understanding reading the many Bible verses
regarding the wealthy. What I take from these verses is the struggle. The struggle to prioritize faith above wealth. The
struggle to not covet money and be able to part with excess wealth.

Luke 18:25 is one of my favorites. Before that verse, Jesus is talking to a ruler who wants to know how he can inherit
eternal life. The ruler claims that he has kept all the commandments since he was a young boy. Jesus hears this and says
to him *"You still lack one thing. Sell everything you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven.
Then come, follow me."*

I always imagine the silence and cycle of expressions on this ruler's face. Shock. Fear. Sadness. The bible says *"he
became very sad because he was very wealthy"*.

After this, Jesus looked at him and said, *"How hard it is for the rich to enter the kingdom of God! Indeed, it is
easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God."*


### Christians and Taxes

The Gospel of Mark shares the words of Jesus as he was being tested by the Pharisees. They were questioning him about
paying the imperial tax to Caesar. Jesus said to them, *"Give back to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's"*.

You will find several examples of how protestant reformers would argue that a virtuous government helps the poor drawing
on Psalm 72.

Paul the Apostle wrote to the Romans how to handle their relationship between God and the civil government.

> This is also why you pay taxes, for the authorities are God's servants, who give their full time to
governing. Give to everyone what you owe them: If you owe taxes, pay taxes; if revenue, then revenue; if respect, then
respect; if honor, then honor.
> 
> \- <cite>Romans 13:6-7</cite>

### Conclusion

Giving favor to the rich is not something the Bible teaches us. Policies that favor the wealthy and privileged provide
no benefits to others. Government has to tax fairly, and Christians must *"Give back to government what is the
government's and to God what is God's"*.
