Redemption Rye Whiskey is an attempt at reviving what was once a staple of the pre-prohibition spirits. This straight rye whiskey comes in at 46% alcohol or 92 proof. This particular bottle is labeled batch number 263.

What makes Redemption Rye whiskey unique is that it is a mash of 96% *premium* rye and 5% barley. Aged in charred new oak barrels, this liquor similar to our friend bourbon.

## Neat

Letting the neat pour set, the fragrance of the distillation is sweet. Notes of brown sugar and citrus. Taking a deep sip, the sweetness floods the pallet followed immediately by a fiery pungent spice. As the spirit travels back the spice follows, but the whiskey is tame. This finish contains notes of resinous oak, vanilla, tangy citrus, and bird's eye pepper.

## Opened Up

Added a small ice cube to try to open the spirit up. Taking a deep draw after the cube has partially melted reveals more sweet brown sugar. The water has toned down the spice. Tame but present in the finish, the spice mellows. Another draw and more spiced brown sugar. Cooked. A flash of caustic spice followed by lighter resinous oak and pepper.

## Conclusion

This Redemption Rye is good, but overall a little disappointed with the flavor profile. The sweet start and spicy finish of the neat pour were exciting, but there was a caustic/chemical flash to the pallet on many occasions. The flavor profile was inconsistent. For this reason, I would give Redemption Rye Straight Whiskey (batch number 263) and 88/100.
