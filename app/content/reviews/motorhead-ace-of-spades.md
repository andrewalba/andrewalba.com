I won't lie. I bought this more for my love of Lemmy Kilmister and Motörhead than my love of whiskey. Most celebrity 
endorsed spirits fall are over-priced and fail to deliver. This Ace of Spades "Sturgis Edition" was intriguing as it
was barreled, blended and bottled by the award-winning small batch distiller Proof Artisan Distillers out of Fargo, 
ND.

This straight bourbon has been aged four years in charred oak barrels. The blend consists of 60% corn, 36% rye and 4% 
barley. The high rye was an intentional "punch in the mouth" to represent the raucous rock'n'roll flavors that a 
Motörhead fan can appreciate.

## Neat

The late afternoon in Minnesota was chilly this November day, so we started the drink outside on the deck. The bottle 
is classy and the bottle indicates that this was bottle number 435. The pour was golden and was slightly lighter 
into the glass.

Nosing the pour, was hit by the peppery and tangy oak. Because of the dark color, I was expecting sweet vanilla and 
caramels. Those aromas came at a flash near the end of my sniff.

My first nip of the spirit was surprising. The drink was subtle and sweet to start. Your traditional caramel brown 
sugar and oak, but the high rye provided hints of sweet cinnamon and black pepper.

The finish was smooth for a straight whiskey, but then this is only 90 proof.

## Opened Up

Added a small amount of water and let it open up. The sweetness evaporated and was left with a peppery oak. 
A few sips revealed an occasional hint of tobacco and or cocoa. The drink was consistent with the typical bourbon 
flavors of sweet caramel and the rye provided an enjoyable heat.

## Conclusion

This Motörhead Ace of Spades straight bourbon delivers a traditional bourbon flavor with the bonus of some peppery rye. 
The spirit tastes much better than it noses. The price point was fair (under $50 for a 750ml). I was delightfully 
surprised with the bottle, but I don't know that I would purchase more than once.

This spirit has the classic bourbon flavors with the bonus of some spicy rye.In the end, I have to give this Sturgis 
Edition of the Motörhead Ace of Spades straight bourbon an 85/100.
