## Preliminary statement

Alba Web Studio LLC (sometimes referred to in this policy as "we" or "us") maintains its online
presence and provides services to customers and users via its website at [https://andrewalba.com/](https://andrewalba.com/)
("Website"). The Website's primary purpose is: Blog to share code, lifestyle and other adventures. One
of the most important issues that any company must address is that of its customers' and users' privacy.
We believe that our privacy policy is one that adheres to all relevant laws, regulations, and customs
while at the same time is readily accessible and understandable. We take great pride in the trust that you
place in us and our Website. For our Website to be effective, we must collect certain information from
you. If you do not agree with any of the terms or practices described in this privacy policy, please do
not access our Website or applications. Through the use of our Website, you are consenting to the
provisions set forth in this privacy policy.

We reserve the right to make changes to this privacy policy at any time. If you want to make sure you
are up to date with our privacy policy, we advise you to visit this page frequently.

### What does our privacy policy cover?

This privacy policy covers our treatment of your Personally Identifiable Information (as defined below)
that we may collect when you access our Website or any application. This privacy policy does not
apply to the practices of any company that we do not control or own, people that we do not employ or
directly manage, or third-party websites that we do not own, control, or manage. If you visit a website
that we mention or link to, be sure to review that website's privacy policy.

Our policy allows us to collect information from you in a manner that will allow you to retain control
over your personal information, but still allow us to make your online visit to our Website safe,
satisfying, and rewarding. We use your information to make it easier for you to access information and
services provided on our Website. The information allows us to provide you with a personalized
experience. Use of any of the services on our Website is entirely voluntary; however, if you do not
provide the Personally Identifiable Information if requested by us, then we may elect not to make the
related services available for your use.

### Information we collect

There are two types of general information that are typically collected online: Anonymous Information
and Personally Identifiable Information.

Anonymous Information is information that cannot be traced back to a specific person. While we may
have a hit counter on a page on our Website, that counter only tracks the number of hits, it does not
collect any specific information about our visitors. This is an example of Anonymous Information.

Personally Identifiable Information is information that tells us about you and may include the
following:

- Name

and similar information that helps identify you. This information is needed to allow us to personalize
your experience on our Website. When we request Personally Identifiable Information from you, we
may include a link to these privacy policies, and inform you what information is required and what
information is optional.

We may collect information from you directly in several ways such as when you place an order,
become a member, maintain a "wish list," complete a survey, or enter contest. We collect information if
you sign up to receive a newsletter, or if you contact us.

We may collect information about you from third parties so we can provide better, more personalized
content and services for you, such as our service and marketing partners, with whom we might co-
brand, promote, or engage in joint marketing activities.

### How we use your information

We use your information to improve your experience on our Website. We may use the information to:

- Respond to your requests for help, comments, or concerns about our Website

### Users who are children and their parents

Our Website does not knowingly collect Personally Identifiable Information from and about children.
We are sensitive to the issues involved in collecting such information from children and have taken
steps to ensure the privacy of any minors accessing our Website. If it is determined that such
information has been inadvertently collected, we will take the steps necessary to ensure that such
information is deleted from our database or that verifiable parental consent is obtained. Our Website
established guidelines that operate in connection with our adherence to the Federal Childrenâ€™s Online
Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA): http://www.ftc.gov/ogc/coppa1.htm. We strongly agree with
the intent of COPPA and have structured our COPPA policy to enable us to collect only the information
from children that is necessary for their access to our Website service; and, then only after obtaining
verifiable consent from their parents.

We strongly recommend that any information about children submitted to our Website be of the type
that would typically appear in a local newspaper. Accordingly, information that is not appropriate for
local newspapers should not be posted to our Website.

### Information we share

We will not sell, rent, or otherwise provide your Personally Identifiable Information to anyone except
as provided in this privacy policy. However, we may send Personally Identifiable Information about our
users to other companies or people when:

- we need to share your Personally Identifiable Information to provide a product or service that
you requested;
- we need to send the Personally Identifiable Information to third parties that provide services on
our behalf to provide you with a product or service you requested;
- we use marketing partners to help us audit the quality and effectiveness of advertisements,
provide analytic services and similar services;
- we use third parties (such as Google and/or Facebook) to collect and analyze information about
the use of our Website. This information helps us provide relevant advertisements to you and
measure the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns;
- we use third-party shipping and credit card processing partners to enable them to properly fulfill
your product and service requests. Our partners are not permitted to retain, share, store or use
this Personally Identifiable Information for any secondary or other purposes not directly related
to fulfillment of your product and service requests;
- we have your consent to share your Personally Identifiable Information;
- we respond to subpoenas, court orders, or legal processes or take other steps to remain in
compliance with applicable laws; or
- we find that your actions on our Website violate our Terms of Use or any of our usage guidelines
for our services.

In most respects, you will deal directly with our third-party advertisers and their shipping and credit
card processing partners. Therefore, our users should carefully review our advertisers' privacy policies
and terms and conditions prior to entering into a transaction with such advertisers.

### Cookies

We collect information about you through online tracking. We use, as do third-party service providers,
tracking technology like browser cookies, web beacons and pixels on our Website, applications, and in
emails we send to you. Cookies are pieces of data stored on hard drives that contain information about
you and your activity. Web beacons and pixels help us understand how you interact with our Website.
Cookies are not linked to Personally Identifiable Information while users are on our Website. Cookies
may allow you to only log into the Website once while remembering your username and password for
future access. Cookies may be rejected by you, but the rejection may result in more limited access to
the services we provide since our services may be personalized to you. Cookies may also be used to
allow access to sweepstakes, contests and other events. Some of our advertisers utilize cookies;
however, we do not have control over or access to their cookies. We use cookies to monitor Website
activity, not user activity. If you choose not to accept cookies, you should be aware that you may not be
able to experience the full functionality of our Website.

Our Website does not recognize "Do Not Track" browser signals.

### Links

Our Website contains links to other websites. Some of these websites may display our product logos,
our products, or other content provided by us. Please understand that we are not responsible for the
privacy practices of these other websites. We recommend that you be aware when you leave our
Website and that you read the privacy policies of the other websites to see how they treat information
they collect. By providing access to third-party websites or advertisements, we are not endorsing the
products or services provided by the owners or operators of such websites. Consequently, we will not
be responsible for the accuracy, relevancy, availability, reliability, copyright compliance, legality or
decency of the material contained in such third-party websites linked to our Website. We strongly
encourage you to make whatever investigation you feel is necessary or appropriate before proceeding
with any online or offline transaction. This privacy policy applies only to the information collected by
us via our Website.

### Newsletters

We plan on publishing newsletters that you can subscribe to. The newsletters will be sent via email and
you will need to provide contact information in order to receive the newsletters.

### Security

We take our commitment to protect your information seriously. When you submit sensitive information
to our Website, the information is protected both online and offline.

When our registration and order forms request you to enter sensitive information (credit card or social
security numbers), the information is encrypted and is protected with SSL technology.

Even though we use SSL encryption technology to protect your sensitive information online, we also
employ internal procedures to protect sensitive information offline. Access to all of our users' sensitive
information is restricted to only those employees that require access. We instruct our employees during
the course of their tenure regarding protecting our users' confidential and sensitive information and we
perform periodic checks of how the employees adhere to our policies. We maintain our servers in a
secure and locked facility that restricts access to only those employees and technicians that require
access. Our security policies are periodically reviewed and enhanced as necessary. Only authorized
employees and technicians have access to the information provided by our users.

Due to the nature of technology, you are also partially responsible for the security of their information.
Since people have become accustomed to the internet, browser technology has made it easier for
everyone to return to their favorite websites without re-entering their usernames and passwords. While
this is easier for surfing, when Personally Identifiable Information is associated with the log-in
information, your security could be affected. We strongly recommend that you do not save their
username and password in your browsers and that you either remember their log-in information or store
your usernames and passwords separately to avoid unauthorized access to your information from your
devices.

Additional information regarding our security practices can be obtained by emailing questions to
privacy@andrewalba.com.

We also offer the following advice:

- If you share your device with other people, remember to log off our Website before leaving it.
- Don't share your password with anyone. If you store your log in information in your computer,
remember to password protect that information. No one from our Website will ever ask for your
password.
- If asked, don't give out your personal information.
- If you are unsure about the information you are providing, ask us, another administrator, or
another person before posting the information.
- If there is information that you would not like to see in your local newspaper, don't post it to our
Website.
- When in doubt, ask us at [privacy@andrewalba.com](mailto:privacy@andrewalba.com).

### Announcements

As we add new services to our Website, we will inform our users of the additional features. We may
also send announcements regarding updates to the service and information regarding maintenance.
Since these messages contain important information regarding the service, our users are not permitted
to opt out of receiving these messages.

### Corrections to personal information

If your Personally Identifiable Information changes, or you wish to terminate your participation in our
service, we will try to provide a way to correct, update, or remove your Personally Identifiable
Information from our servers. These updates and removals can be initiated on our users' information
pages by our Website administrator or by sending a message to privacy@andrewalba.com. In
extenuating circumstances, we can address these issues via telephone or regular U.S. Postal Service.
Some information may remain on our servers including in our archived records after termination of an
account.

### Opting out

We value your privacy and provide you with the ability to "opt out" of having your information used
for purposes not directly related to our Website service and the purposes for which the information is
requested. For instance, our registration form has a box that can be checked you to opt out of having
their information used for marketing purposes or shared with third-party partners of our Website.

If you previously accepted our newsletter or promotional materials and no longer want to receive these
messages, you may opt out of receiving additional messages by clicking the "Unsubscribe" link at the
bottom of the message, replying with "unsubscribe" in the subject line of the email, or by emailing us at
[privacy@andrewalba.com](mailto:privacy@andrewalba.com). You may also return to your information page to 
edit the information regarding receiving messages and newsletters and choose the opt-out option.

If any user information is being shared with third parties or collected by third parties, we provide prior
notice to our users, in order to allow them to make an informed decision regarding allowing the
information to be collected and proceeding with the third-party transaction or not.

### Changes to our privacy policy

If we decide to change our privacy policy, we will inform you of what information we collect, how we
use the information, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose the information to third parties.
If at any time we decide to use Personally Identifiable Information in a manner different from that
stated at the time the information was collected, we will notify you via an email. You will then have the
opportunity to opt out of allowing us to use the information. Users that fail to respond to the change of
policy message will not have their information utilized pursuant to the new policies since we will
implement the policies for all information collected from the time of the change forward. We will use
the information in accordance with the privacy policy under which it was collected.
