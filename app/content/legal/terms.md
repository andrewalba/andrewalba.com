   offenders.

services infringes a copyright, please send a notice of copyright infringement containing the
following information to the Designated Agent listed below ("Proper Bona Fide
Infringement Notification"):

- Identification of works or materials being infringed;
- Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing including information regarding the location of the infringing materials that the copyright owner seeks to have removed, with sufficient detail so that we are capable of finding and verifying its existence;
- Contact information about the notifier including address, telephone number and, if available, email address;
- A statement that the notifier has a good faith belief that the material is not authorized by the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and

- that for repeat offenders, we will also terminate such content provider's, member's or user's access to the service.

c. **Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent**

If the content provider, member or user believes that the material that was removed or to
which access was disabled is either not infringing, or the content provider, member or user
believes that it has the right to post and use such material from the copyright owner, the
copyright owner's agent, or pursuant to the law, the content provider, member or user must
send a counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent listed

d. **Removal**

If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, we may send a copy of the counter-notice
to the original complaining party informing that person that it may replace the
removed material or cease disabling it in 10 business days. Unless the copyright owner files
an action seeking a court order against the content provider, member or user, the removed
material may be replaced or access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after
receipt of the counter-notice, at our discretion.
