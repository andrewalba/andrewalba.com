Where then do I look for good and evil? Not to uncontrollable externals, but within myself to the choices that are my own â€¦"

Happy New Year!

Today is the typical day to start a book like {% daily_stoic %}. I couldn't wait, so my journey started a few months
ago. We learn on the first day, the most important practice of a Stoic philosopher is to separate those matters which
we can control or change from those matters that we have no influence over.

This sounds simple enough when reading in a book. We are human and as humans, we are not always rational. For example,
we can't make someone else like us, no matter how hard we try. We can't make the cashier check us out faster, no matter
how boisterous we become. We can not will the weather to be reasonable when we have plans outdoors.

We can do one mighty task. We can change our future. We can do that by taking control of our choices starting right now!

### Conclusion

Taking time to separate those things which we can control from the things we can't control can seem like a super power.
We can, with a little reflection and focus, make that decision easier. As we begin to master this, the fruits of our
labor will appear in the form of happiness. We will also see we have an advantage over people who struggle with matters
out of their control.
