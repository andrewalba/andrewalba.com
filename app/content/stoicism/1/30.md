In today's world, information is literally at our fingertips. We can call up the answers to our questions with a few 
clicks and a swipe. Knowledge is power, am I right?

Why is Epictetus telling us that if we wish to be an exceptional person, we should *"be content to appear clueless or 
stupid in extraneous matters."* "I don't know" or better yet, "I don't care" would be phrases Epictetus would enjoy us 
saying.

### Conclusion

While knowledge is powerful, the amount of time and energy involved to update continuously is exhausting. Imagine how 
much time you win back if you didn't cruise Facebook. How about removing other media consumption such as news, sports, 
Netflix? We can be more present in this world by disconnecting and work on being rested.
