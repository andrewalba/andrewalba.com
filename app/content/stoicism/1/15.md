        content: "Tranquility can't be grasped except by those who have reached an unwavering and firm power of judgment – the rest constantly fall and rise in their decisions, wavering in a state of alternately rejecting and accepting things. What is the cause of this back and forth? It's because nothing is clear and they rely on the most uncertain guide – common opinion."

Seneca is telling us that tranquility can be found by believing in yourself, and your reasoned choices.

Remorse, insecurity, nervousness. These would not be words to describe someone who has found tranquility. When we have 
confidence in our choices, we don't have a need to compare ourselves to others. We don't question our decision seconds
after we hear of additional information.

### Conclusion

We can find peace once we select our path, and we endure. Our course may require adjustments, but we persist. We ignore 
the interference and opinions of others. We journey forward, staying the course.
