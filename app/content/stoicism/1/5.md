Plan all the way to the end. Do you ever envy those who can plan far out into the future? Planning well into the future,
can feel futile. So much can change between now and then.

Having spent many decades floundering about with no *plan*, planning to the end feels like an impossible task. The
authors of {% daily_stoic %} show us how important planning to the end is, and more importantly the benefits we will
reap.

### Conclusion

Not having a plan will certainly put you on a path towards failure. Take baby steps. Start by planning your days. After
time, move to planning for weeks and months. You will learn that your planning will begin to snowball, and you will find
planning all the way to the end is not only feasible, but empowering. You will find your direction.
