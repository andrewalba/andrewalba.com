Side note. Marcus Aurelius doesn't tell us to look towards the wealthiest, the famous, or the gifted. He calls out *the 
wise*.

Without a ruler to do it against, you can't make crooked straight.

Seneca
::

The wise people in our lives can inspire us. We need to take this relationship one step further and engage with our wise 
friends and family. We should be testing our opinions and assumptions.

### Conclusion

Identify that wise person. It maybe someone that is family. An author. Someone who lived long ago. A pastor. A teacher.
Examine what they do and as Marcus Aurelius says *"what they run away from"*, and then mirror those behaviors.
