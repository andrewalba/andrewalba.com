The last four years have been turbulent at times. We've all had some ups and downs. Perhaps during those lows you may 
have thought, said or acted out in a way that you regret. Maybe you had words with a co-worker. Perhaps jealousy of a 
family member made you wrestle with your heart. Maybe you found yourself being vindictive, petty or mean to a stranger 
because of the bumper sticker on their vehicle or the slogan on their shirt.

We all struggle to maintain steadfast in holding to our fundamental truths and beliefs. When you add stress to the 
equation, the struggle can turn into a battle. Remember, this does not only happen to the worst of humankind, but all 
humankind.

### Conclusion

Failing to meet our own expectations is human. Recognizing and learning from our shortcomings can add value in the form 
of experience and wisdom. While we can't undo what was done in the past, we can accept that those are not the principles 
that define us. We decide when to let go of the past and begin anew. Now would be the best time to start!
