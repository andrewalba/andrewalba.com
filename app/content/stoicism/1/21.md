        content: "Ask yourself the following first thing in the morning: What am I lacking in attaining freedom from passion? What for tranquility? What am I? A mere body, estate-holder, or reputation? None of these things. What, then? A rational being. What then is demanded of me? Meditate on your actions. How did I steer away from serenity? What did I do that was unfriendly, unsocial, or uncaring? What did I fail to do in all these things?"

While researching the lesson from today's :daily-stoic, I was struck by all the inadequacies within my life.

So many people take the time to create healthy rituals for themselves. While I have tried to create rituals in my life, 
nothing has persisted. Often my excuse is time. It is sad that my only morning ritual is I have at least one cup of 
coffee in the morning.

It was important for me to read the quotation over and over. To let each item in the checklist set in. It is the 
realization that life should be more than just *going through the motions*. We need to reflect upon our days. We need 
to question our thoughts, words, and actions.

### Conclusion

It starts today for me. Starting by **MAKING** time to reflect. Making time to journal once again. Making time to ask 
where I failed during the day and reflect on what, within my control, could have made a difference. Creating a healthy 
ritual (morning or night). One (morning or night) at a time, until the ritual is habit.
