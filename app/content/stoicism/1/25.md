    - quote:
        content: "What's left to be prized? This, I think – to limit our action or inaction to only what's in keeping with the needs of our own preparation… it's what the exertions of education and teaching are all about – here is the thing to be prized! If you hold this firmly, you'll stop trying to get yourself all the other things… If you don't , you won't be free, self-sufficient, or liberated from passion, but necessarily full of envy, jealousy, and suspicion for any who have the power to take them, and you'll plot against those who do have what you prize… But by having some self-respect for your own mind and prizing it, you will please yourself and be in better harmony with your fellow human beings, and more in tune with the gods – praising everything they have set in order and allotted you."

There are many stories about millionaires that live like paupers. They drive around in old used cars, live in small 
homes, and live reclusive lives. Perception is that these people pinch every penny. Financial advisers will tell you 
rich people are rich because they don't buy new cars or spend lavishly on new homes.

Truth is more likely that these people are better at prioritizing what is important to them. What brings them happiness?

### Conclusion

When you have the clarity to prioritize what is important and brings you happiness, you become *free*. We often covet 
more than we need. Worse yet, we waste our valuable resource of time in an attempt to gain our desires. Clarity offers 
us a means to simplify and free us to live.
