        content: "Erase the false impressions from your mind by constantly saying to yourself, I have it in my soul to keep out any evil, desire or any kind of disturbance â€” instead, seeing the true nature of things, I will give them only their due. Always remember this power that nature gave you."

Finding your mantra is only the first step to acquire clarity. The second step is the most important. That step is to 
remind yourself often of your mantra.

### Conclusion

We can use the words above from Marcus Aurelius as our mantra.  We can tweak the statement to fit our preference, or we 
can create our mantra. Whichever you decide, the meaningful second step is to repeat your motto often (hourly, daily, 
weekly). The process should allow you to find the clarity you seek.
