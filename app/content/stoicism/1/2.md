        content: "What is the fruit of these teachings? Only the most beautiful and proper harvest of the truly educatedâ€”tranquility, fearlessness, and freedom. We should not trust the masses who say only the free can be educated, but rather the lovers of wisdom who say that only the educated are free."

The title says all that needs to be said. Why do we truly crave to learn a matter? To make our friends jealous? To make
others believe we are intelligent? Doubtful.

We generally crave to learn a matter out of curiousness. We can find the lessons learned from the experience of others
that have lived. Sometimes this can generate a passion, and we might become consumed about a matter, one day making us
experts in the matter.

### Conclusion

When the day is dull, you feel like *vegging out* on a few seasons of some show on Netflix, do yourself a favor and pick
up a book. Take some time to study philosophy, religion or what ever may provide you a spark of passion. Knowledge and
the understanding of oneself is freedom!
