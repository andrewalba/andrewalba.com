Today the authors of {% daily_stoic %} urge us to periodically remind ourselves through the day to make reasoned 
choices. From the time we wake, to the time we have lunch, in the evening and before we go to bed.

We can control what choices we are going to make through the day. We can't control the choices of our co-workers, 
friends, or family. We are just along for the ride, taking the good with the bad.

### Conclusion

Our struggle for clarity throughout the day can be rewarded with a good night of sleep. Then we get to start the entire 
process over in the morning. Our quest is to often remember, we control the choices we make and God and Fortune decide 
the outcomes outside our control.
