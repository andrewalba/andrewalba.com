        content: "So in the majority of other things, we address circumstances not in accordance with the right assumptions, but mostly by following wretched habit. Since all that I've said is the case, the person in training must seek to rise above, so as to stop seeking out pleasure and steering away from pain; to stop clinging to living and abhorring death; and in the case of property and money, to stop valuing receiving over giving."

Have you ever been a part of an event that reoccurred monthly or annually? Have you been involved long enough to see it 
grow or shrink? Is there a pattern for success or failure? Generally there is, and that is the ability to adapt and 
change with time.

Change can be difficult. We might not have the ambition to make change. Perhaps you don't want to offend someone with 
purposing a change. There is a good chance that you don't even realize there is a need for change.

Have you ever questioned a tradition? Questioned a strange custom at your church? Noted an established way of thinking 
that didn't quite make sense? If you answered yes, you are likely ahead of the curve. If you actually offered a more 
appropriate alternative, then you are deserving of praise.

### Conclusion

The {% daily_stoic %} authors tell us we should be *ruthless* in removing our mindlessly reactions and resist just 
following. We should identify our routines and make a point to question them frequently. *"Can this be done better 
another way?"* There is a happiness in knowing you are doing something not only for the right reason, but the best 
possible way.
