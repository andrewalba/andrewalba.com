    - quote:
        content: "The essence of good is a certain kind of reasoned choice; just as the essence of evil is another kind. What about externals, then? They are only the raw material for our reasoned choice, which finds its own good or evil in working with them. How will it find the good? Not by marveling at the material! For if judgments about the material are straight that makes our choices good, but if those judgments are twisted, our choices turn bad."

Eustatheia. Constancy in purpose and affection. Seeking stability in life, we often think of tranquility. The state of 
tranquil could be often associated with quiet and solitude. Our lives are usually the opposite of quiet and solitude, 
but Epictetus gives us direction on how to be steady with the hustle and bustle around us.

We can achieve stability through filtering the outside world in our judgement. We choose our reaction to an action 
through our mental filters. When someone is not following the rules, we choose how their actions are going to affect us.

### Conclusion

Our ability to make considered decisions are twisted because of our inability to reason. We are quick to respond with 
mayhem. Our hearts filled anger, lust or greed, clouding our clarity. If we want *eustatheia*, we need to first find 
clarity. With clarity, we can make our reasoned choice and be steady.
