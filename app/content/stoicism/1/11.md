        content: "For if a person shifts their caution to their own reasoned choices and the acts of those choices, they will at the same time gain the will to avoid, but if they shift their caution away from their own reasoned choices to things not under their control, seeking to avoid what is controlled by others, they will then be agitated, fearful, and unstable."

Our ideas of tranquility often involve some serene landscape, lush with green and a gentle white noise in the 
background. The Stoics were the opposite of this picture. Instead, the Stoics are represented by the worker on the 
jackhammer, the busy office assistant juggling three things at once, the cashier with four customers deep in lineâ€¦ all 
equally at peace. 

### Conclusion

Escaping our everyday lives with pleasures can be rationalized easily in our minds. Masking our stress and disruptive 
problems with instant gratification works for a short time, but reality eventually catches up to us. Epictetus is 
reminding us that our peace and strength is not determined by the environment, but the result of our reasoned choices.
