    - quote:
        content: "At every moment keep a sturdy mind on the task at hand, as a Roman and human being, doing it with strict and simple dignity, affection, freedom, and justice - giving yourself a break from all other considerations. You can do this if you approach each task as if it is your last, giving up every distraction, emotional subversion of reason, and all drama, vanity, and complaint over your fair share. You can see how mastery over a few things makes it possible to live an abundant and devout life â€” for, if you keep watch over these things, the gods won't ask for more."

Happy Birthday to my beautiful wife Pauline!

Absent in distractions. The rabbit hole of starting one effort and an hour later find yourself doing a completely 
different task. You find that you never finished the initial assignment. In no way are you satisfied with your results.

Marcus Aurelius wants to remind us to keep it simple. Moreover, treat your task as if it will be your last!

### Conclusion

It might feel silly to approach every task at hand as if it will be your last. If you're honest, the impact it will have 
is significant. You can tune your focus and find clarity in the process. Keep it simple, then simply *do your job*.
