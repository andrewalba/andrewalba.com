        content: "Don't return to philosophy as a task-master, but as patients seek out relief in a treatment of sore eyes, or a dressing for a burn, or from an ointment. Regarding it this way, you'll obey reason without putting it on display and rest easy in its care."

As we achieve success in life, we can get caught up with work and other daily tasks. We find a rhythm that works for us 
because we are active. Our season of life may change, and we drift away from philosophy and or faith.

As time progresses, the negative aspects of life begin to snowball. We can become overwhelmed with stress, allow our 
judgment to be clouded, or even physically injure ourselves. Marcus Aurelius is telling us we can save ourselves some 
pain by never drifting too far from philosophy.

### Conclusion

Stoicism can nurture our souls. Philosophy can help us navigate through the struggles of modern life and restore our 
happiness and passions. We can rest easy as we pursue stoicism, allowing it to heal us.
