Upon reflection of today's reading, I've learned a deep understanding requires time. Knowing a topic, may only 
take a few moments, but a deep understanding requires absorbing and questioning the material you desire to learn. Can 
you break it? What if you approach the subject from different angles, will the question hold up?

### Conclusion

We can know many topics, but deep understanding requires taking time to examine and nurture the content. For me, 
it requires reading the same material multiple times. Time to reflect and acknowledge. An opportunity for observation 
and contemplation
