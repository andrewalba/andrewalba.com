While painting a mental picture with his words, Marcus Aurelius also provide us with a brilliant metaphor on life with 
a poetic prose.

We all have the ability to create poetic statements just as Marcus Aurelius has above. Beautiful paintings or dark 
portraits of our experiences and life. Once we are able to see the simplicity, purity, and lucidity of our surroundings, 
the words will follow.

### Conclusion

Observing our world, our actions, and why we do them helps us gain clarity. It is this clarity that can provide us joy 
and happiness. Be curious. Be active. Use your experiences and clarity to find the charm and balance that others fail 
to see. Then you will find a larger palette to paint your surroundings with.
