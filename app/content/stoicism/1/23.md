The lifestyles of the rich and famous capture our attention more than those of our neighbors and family. While we *ooh* 
and *aww* how wealth provides meany pleasures, we forget that riches do not always bring happiness.

Seneca is reminding us that wealth cannot fix what is in our hearts. Material possessions will not mend an emotional 
wound. We cannot purchase a moral code to execute.

### Conclusion

Wealth can provide us a degree of comfort, but lavish spending leads to short-term pleasure and rarely too long-term 
happiness. Believing wealth is necessary for happiness will only lead to more devastation and suffering.
