        content: "A person who doesn't know what the universe is, doesn't know where they are. A person who doesn't know their purpose in life doesn't know who they are or what the universe is. A person who doesn't know any one of these things doesn't know why they are here. So what to make of people who seek or avoid the praise of those who have no knowledge of where or who they are?"

An interesting observation. We get some of these questions often, but our answers are generally generic and superficial.
How many times have you politely answered the questions "What do you do?" or "Where are you from?" with an answer that
only touches the actual surface. More important, have we really ever thought about the questions beyond the peripheral
short answer we provide?

### Conclusion

Don't hesitate to put earnest thought into questions about "*who you are*" and "*where are you*". Our answers need to be
reasoned, honest and maybe even uncomfortable to others. When we look to please others, we are directed to discouraging
or unrealistic paths. If we want to find direction in life, a path to follow, we need to find clarity with regard to
what is important in our life.
