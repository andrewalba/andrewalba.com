    - quote:
        content: "I am your teacher and you are learning in my school. My aim is to bring you to completion, unhindered, free from compulsive behavior, unrestrained, without shame, free, flourishing, and happy, looking to God in things great and small – your aim is to learn and diligently practice all these things. Why then don't you complete the work, if you have the right aim and I have both the right aim and right preparation? What is missing? … The work is quite feasible, and is the only thing in your power … Let go of the past. We must only begin. Believe me and you will see."

The authors of {% daily_stoic %} would have us believe that teenagers are halfhearted and lazy with their efforts. This 
allows them to have ready the excuse that *"It doesn't matter, I wasn't even trying"*. This is not how I remember my 
adolescence.

My teen years involved a lot of trying and a lot of failure, but in my case I did not care. My personality was outgoing. 
My modesty was not to be found at the time. Many trials that ended in failure were repeated in hopes for a different 
outcome. Looking back, I think failure was synonymous with losing, and ask anyone that knew me then … **I hated 
losing**.

Something changed when I became a young adult. If I am being honest, I found I was no longer faster, smarter, stronger,
wittier, better than everyone else. I was average. Hubris had been my shield, and the modesty that came with the reality 
of the world stripped the shield away.

### Conclusion

Don't let failure intimidate you. With experience comes the ability to make sound reasoned choices. Stoicism is our 
guide, but we need to *begin* our journey and follow with hard work. As the authors say, "The rest follows".
