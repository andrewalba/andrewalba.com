Happy Birthday Dayton!

Knowing what is inside our circle of control (and what is outside it) is what makes us wise. For someone new to 
Stoicism, this might feel like a daunting task. The reality is that we only need to control one thing… **OUR MIND**.

The thought that our bodies are not in our circle might not seem correct. We eat healthily, exercise regularly, and get 
all the rest we need to stay fit. Disease and illness don't always follow the rules and afflict us the same. Wealthy 
or poor, young or old, famous or anonymous, we can all be burdened the same. 

### Conclusion

While our circle of control might seem limited, we can take heart in the simplicity. Our list of responsibilities is 
only one item long. Our circle of control is simple: our choices, our will, and our mind.
