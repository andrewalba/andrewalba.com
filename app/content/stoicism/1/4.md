These are the three essentials of Stoic philosophy. Perception. Action. Will. Of course there is more to Stoicism, but
these three disciplines are the essentials.

While I am supplementing :daily-stoic with another book about the Stoics, I am still unable to tell you what each
Stoic philosopher brought to the table from memory. Instead of having all of that to memorize, we can begin with the
three critical disciplines and build from there.

### Conclusion

Control our perceptions. Direct our actions properly. Willingly accept what's outside our control. Sounds simple enough.
