        content: "The proper work of the mind is the exercise of choice, refusal, yearning, repulsion, preparation, purpose, and assent. What then can pollute and clog the mindâ€™s proper functioning? Nothing but its own corrupt decisions."

:daily-stoic simply breaks these all down.

Choice
: virtuous thoughts and actions

Refusal
: learning when to say no

Yearning
: to grow and become a better version of yourself

Repulsion
: of all that is not virtuous

Preparation
: expectations that may lie ahead and acceptance of what may happen

Purpose
: our guiding principle and highest priority

Assent
: honesty to ourselves about what is within and outside our control

Swept up with the events of yesterday, January 6, 2021, old habit returned. Wasted time on social media. Wasted thought
hoping to change others minds. Need to have hourly reminder to free myself from being upset with things outside my
control and focus on the things that are in my control.

### Conclusion

Our mind is a powerful tool if we allow. Focusing on the above will help you see through the haze that pollutes and
corrupts our minds.
