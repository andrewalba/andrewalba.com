What a great reflection in regard to what is often the roller coaster of life. Our social and economic status at birth 
can influence the ease or difficulty of our life.

We learn in today's lesson that we have not direct control on our powers or misfortune, but we can decide to focus on 
what is within our control. The *seasons of life* we go through can have *waves* of highs that come crashing down only 
to swell up once again. While we may feel helpless, we always have freedom of choice.

### Conclusion

When we realize the power  that our freedom of choice has, we will have clarity. Whether a wealthy politician or a 
struggling single parent, our choices matter. What are our choices? How will we evaluate our choices? How will we make 
the most of our choices? These are the questions that we should evaluate, regardless of our status. How will we answer?
