What a powerful and gracious reminder to be kind.

Someone can be evil without knowing anything better. People understand cruelty when that is all that they have 
experienced. Deprived of the truth, this is their life.

### Conclusion

Knowing others have been deprived of the truth, we can begin to forgive and respond with compassion and graciousness.
