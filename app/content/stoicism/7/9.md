I am going off course a little with this lesson. I recently read an article about the repurposing of Stoic philosophy 
for the modern era in [Vice](https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgxvmw/the-revival-of-stoicism).

The article painted an unflattering look of Stoicism. The news article pointed out how many are using Stoicism to 
justify their lives.

The truth is that many will pick and choose the lessons of a philosophy or religion for their benefit. The Westboro 
Baptist Church has twisted Christian teachings to fit their narrative of hate. Far-right Republican groups misrepresent 
or blatantly lie about facts to scare up support for their agenda. Far-left groups are now bullying and resorting to 
violence in the name of protest.

### Conclusion

I have come to understand that I can not control the path of Christianity, the course of politics, or the violent nature 
of others. My choice is to read, to learn, to be empathetic, and be the best version of myself. I can be true to 
Stoicism and my faith. Become an inspiration to my family, friends, and community by my example.
