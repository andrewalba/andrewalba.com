        content: "When you see someone often flashing their rank or position, or someone whose name is often bandied about in public, don't be envious; such things are bought at the expense of life. &hellip; Some die on the first rungs of the ladder of success, others before they can reach the top, and the few that make it to the top of their ambition through a thousand indignities realize at the end it's only for an inscription on their gravestone."

Working hard can be admirable. How do we know when we are working too much? Are we working hard to complete our job or 
working for glory and recognition?

Advancing through the professional ladder of success can be exciting but can also come at a cost to our family and 
health. One positive outcome of the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 is the spotlight shined on work-life balance.

### Conclusion

Our being is not to be beasts of burden. We need to be happy with doing our duty well and not concern ourselves with any 
praise beyond that.
