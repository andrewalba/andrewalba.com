The long list of chores has been piling up. As the list grows, so does the stress to get the list done. Have a setback? 
The world feels like it is punching at you.

Epictetus is asking us to *roll with the punches*. Acceptance takes away most of the sting.

### Conclusion

All chores and setbacks are opportunities. Chances to make the lives of others and ourselves better.
