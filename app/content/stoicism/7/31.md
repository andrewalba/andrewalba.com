Our career can bring us happiness. Your career should not define your life.  We need to be more than the one dimension 
of our job.

### Conclusion

Enjoy your work. Take satisfaction in what we can accomplish. Beyond that, make sure to know when to disconnect from the 
office. Grow as a person with new knowledge and different surroundings. We can be much more than the one-dimensional 
worker bee.
