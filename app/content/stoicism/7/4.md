The authors of {% daily_stoic %} compare the goodness inside us to that of a small flame. As the keeper of this flame, 
we are responsible for maintaining the fire every day.

We need to find ways to feed the flame, keep the fire from being blown away and make sure it does not become barricaded.

### Conclusion

We can not control the small fire within others. We can maintain our flame and continue to shine our small light into 
the world.
