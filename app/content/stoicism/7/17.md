    - quote:
        content: "As you move forward along the path of reason, people will stand in your way. They will never be able to keep you from doing what's sound, so don't let them knock out your goodwill for them. Keep a steady watch on both fronts, not only for well-based judgments and actions, but also for gentleness with those who would obstruct our path or create other difficulties. For getting angry is also a weakness, just as much as abandoning the task or surrendering under panic. For doing either is an equal desertion â€” the one by shrinking back and the other by estrangement from family and friend."

Improving one's self does not make one superior to others. We are simply taking a different path. Our path still has 
room for those who may be struggling with their journey.

### Conclusion

Avoid the temptation of following the popular trails. Avoid being distracted by friends and family who crisscross our 
paths, but do not abandon them. Be calm, patient and remember how easy it can be to wander on a trail that is not so 
clear.
