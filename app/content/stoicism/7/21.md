Who depends on you? Parents? Children? Spouse? Friends?

Is it possible you can't see the bigger picture? Our lives connect further, outside our family through our work. While 
we are all expendable, our skills are still dependent upon until someone finds our replacement.

### Conclusion

Without you, websites don't get built. Taxes don't get filed. Shelves do not get restocked. Many in our community depend 
upon us. Our duty is our purpose
