There was a tale I heard when younger. "A" students will end up working for "C" students. As someone who was an "A" 
student, this did not compute.

This lesson helps make light of what could be going on. In my experience, I was successful because I could memorize 
dates, quotes, and formulas. My struggle was in understanding *meaning*. Understanding a story was difficult as I read 
the story in its literal sense.

### Conclusion

Knowing dates, quotes, and formulas is only one aspect of learning. Understanding undertones and empathy helps us 
develop a deeper understanding.

Read and scrutinize to live and to be a good person.
