    - quote:
        content: "Indeed, if you find anything in human life better than justice, truth, self-control, courage—in short, anything better than the sufficiency of your own mind, which keeps you acting according to the demands of true reason and accepting what fate gives you outside of your own power of choice — I tell you, if you can see anything better than this, turn to it heart and soul and take full advantage of this greater good you've found."

We have all likely had the same thoughts. If only I could get that promotion, my work life would be easier. Having that 
new electronic device would keep me connected better. If I had more money, my family life would be complete.

In reality, the promotion requires more hours at work, the new electronic device detaches us from the world, and the 
additional money comes with its own set of troubles.

### Conclusion

What can fulfill our lives then?

We can fill our life with virtue. Build a life that centers around justice, honesty, discipline, and courage. We should 
endeavor to live a life of goodness.
