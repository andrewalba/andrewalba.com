    - quote:
        content: "My reasoned choice is as indifferent to the reasoned choice of my neighbor, as to his breath and body. However much we've been made for cooperation, the ruling reason in each of us is master of its own affairs. If this weren't the case, the evil in someone else could become my harm, and God didn't mean for someone else to control my misfortune."

This lesson reminds me of how much I have grown in my faith.

It is easy to get upset and frustrated when others are blatantly not following the rules. When you add in religion, this 
becomes magnified. We are quick to point out all the sins of the world but downplay our sins.

### Conclusion

We should not be condemning others until we have resolved our own sinful lives. We need to keep an open mind to others.  
We must master our own lives before we can begin to try to master the lives of others.
