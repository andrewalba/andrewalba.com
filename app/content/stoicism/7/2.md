        content: "Never shirk the proper dispatch of your duty, no matter if you are freezing or hot, groggy or well-rested, vilified or praised, not even if dying or pressed by other demands. Even dying is one of the important assignments of life and, in this as in all else, make the most of your resources to do well the duty at hand."

The enormity of choices can weigh us down. How does a person flesh out what is right and what is wrong?

While the best choice may not always be obvious, we can use our instinct, intuition, and consciousness to make the right 
decision.

### Conclusion

How fitting that Marcus Aurelius points out that even dying is a duty. Not the actual act of death, but all of those 
choices afforded us until that day.
