        content: "Some people are sharp and others dull; some are raised in a better environment, others in worse, the latter, having inferior habits and nurture, will require more by way of proof and careful instruction to master these teachings and to be formed by them — in the same way that bodies in a bad state must be given a great deal of care when perfect health is sought."

During the 2020 election cycle, there were many times these thoughts or words came out, "This person is an idiot!" or 
"How can they ignore the facts?"

It can be difficult for me to concede, but our lives are full of privilege. We see this every day. Two people are equal 
at a task, but one achieves a promotion while the other lingers in the same position.

### Conclusion

What is missing? Empathy. To be forgiving and tolerant. Once we become empathetic, we can understand the gifts of 
privilege. We can patiently listen and help others make informed decisions.
