        content: "Good people will do what they find honorable to do, even if it requires hard work; they'll do it even if it causes them injury; they'll do it even if it will bring danger. Again, they won't do what they find base, even if it brings wealth, pleasure, or power. Nothing will deter them from what is honorable, and nothing will lure them into what is base."

Hard work. Injury. Danger. These are words that are difficult to expect for choosing to be morally good. Seneca points 
out that we can expect to endure these hardships as good people.

### Conclusion

Our path as a Stoic may require hard work, while others choose indolence. We may experience injury or danger while 
others elect the path of least resistance. A Stoic must resist the superficially attractive prizes. Nothing should deter 
us from what is honorable.
