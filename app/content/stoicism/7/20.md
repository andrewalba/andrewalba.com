        content: "The unjust person acts against the gods. For insofar as the nature of the universe made rational creatures for the sake of each other, with an eye toward mutual benefit based on true value and never for harm, anyone breaking nature's will obviously acts against the oldest of gods."

With rare exceptions, we all know when something is sinful or wrong. The result of our wrongdoing is guilt.

If we know our acts are wrong, why do we continue them? For most, we are simply taking the *easy* way out. We follow the 
path of least resistance.

### Conclusion

Our duty should be to embrace our natural inclination. Be virtuous and commit to doing the *right thing*. Listen to that 
angel on our shoulder.
