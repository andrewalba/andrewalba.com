    - quote:
        content: "One person, on doing well by others, immediately accounts the expected favor in return. Another is not so quick, but still considers the person a debtor and knows the favor. A third kind of person acts as if not conscious of the deed, rather like a vine producing a cluster of grapes without making further demands, like a horse after its race, or a dog after its walk, or a bee after making its honey. Such a person, having done a good deed, won't go shouting from rooftops but simply moves on to the next deed just like the vine produces another bunch of grapes in the right season."

Our perception of a leader is often a person of authority. Politicians.  Shift supervisors. Coaches. Business 
executives.

These people can be leaders, but they are often not true leaders.

True leaders are all around us. They are the friends who help you with no expectations. Relatives who serve and never 
brag about their achievements. Co-workers who lift us when we are falling behind.

### Conclusion

A leader strives for everyone to be successful. A leader leads because of duty and never for thanks and recognition.
