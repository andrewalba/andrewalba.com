Temper our reactions. Compliments can make us vain. Critics can leave us humiliated. What if we treated compliments and 
critics the same?

We can handle compliments and criticism the same way. Receive, acknowledge, apply, and let go. Acknowledge the praise or 
critic for what it is and nothing more. Apply reason. After we have learned what we need, let go of the compliment or criticism.

### Conclusion

What others think and say of us does not define us. Our actions and responses are what characterize us.
