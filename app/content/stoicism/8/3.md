There is a certain allure of the tranquil farm, the luxurious mansion, or the secluded cottage. We deceive ourselves 
into believing this is where we can lead a good life.

We neglect to remember that farms need tending, mansions require a constant stream of money, and seclusion can lead to 
loneliness.

### Conclusion

We can live the good life where we are. More importantly, we can start it now! Being realistic and flexible, we can 
choose to live the good life where we are.
