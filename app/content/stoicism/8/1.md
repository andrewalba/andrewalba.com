    - quote:
        content: "That cucumber is bitter, so toss it out! There are thorns on the path, then keep away! Enough said. Why ponder the existence of nuisance? Such thinking would make you a laughing-stock to the true student of Nature, just as a carpenter or cobbler would laugh if you pointed out the sawdust and chips on the floors of their shops. Yet while those shopkeepers have dustbins for disposal, Nature has no need of them."

Waiting for perfection can become an obstacle. We convince ourselves that we have to wait for the right moment to start 
a task, but the moment may never come.

Why wait for perfection? Start now and work with what you have. While you may not achieve the same initial results, you 
increase the chances that you will finish your task.

### Conclusion

Life is not perfect because the world around us is not perfect. You are your only obstacle. Stow away the trivial 
aggravations and insignificant restrictions and start now.
