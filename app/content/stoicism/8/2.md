Life does not always go as we plan. Our reaction to those obstacles that life throws at us has a profound effect on us.

When we are young, we take our health for granted. With age comes ailments and limitations. We have the choice to give 
up things we enjoy and waste away or find ways to improve our health and enjoy life again.

### Conclusion

Change your perspective. The world is not full of obstacles and problems. The world is full of new opportunities waiting 
for a creative mind to resolve.
