        content: "It's ruinous for the soul to be anxious about the future and miserable in advance of misery, engulfed by anxiety that the things it desires might remain its own until the very end. For such a soul will never be at rest - by longing for things to come it will lose the ability to enjoy present things."

If we think about it, we often anticipate an outcome that is more miserable than the actual outcome. There is a 
distinction between planning for the worse case scenario and developing an ulcer anticipating the scenario.

### Conclusion

Any energy spent anticipating an outcome is wasted. It is time that could be used to enjoy the moment or work on 
alternative responses. It is what it is, don't make it more than it is. Better yet, be so busy working or enjoying your
time that you don't care.
