        content: "This can be swiftly taught in very few words: virtue is the only good; there is no certain good without virtue; and virtue resides in our nobler part, which is the rational one. And what can this virtue be? True and steadfast judgment. For from this will arise every mental impulse, and by it every appearance that spurs our impulses will be rendered clear."

What trait can we find in all of those who we respect? Consistency. They hold a firmness of constitution. You can rely 
on them in your good times and your bad times.

Consistency requires rational thought. Consistencies opposite is impulsiveness. It is difficult, if not impossible, to 
find harmony within impulsive decisions.

### Conclusion

We are **the sum of all of our actions**. When our actions are impulsive, we lose control of our lives. If instead, we 
choose to reflect on our action before acting can help us control our lives.
