Don't get swept away with trivial matters. Our time is valuable and we should avoid wasting it on those things that do 
not deserve our time.

### Conclusion

Letting the small things take over our lives not only robs us of our time wasted on the matter, but also is time we do
not have to share with those we love, on our health and on our mental well being.
