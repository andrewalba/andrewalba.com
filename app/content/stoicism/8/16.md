        content: "Just as the nature of rational things has given to each person their rational powers, so it also gives us this power â€” just as nature turns to its own purpose any obstacle or any opposition, sets its place in the destined order, and co-opts it, so every rational person can convert any obstacle into the raw material for their own purpose."

A repeating theme in Stoicism is to find the opportunities within our problems. How do we find a way to use the *lemons* 
that life throws at us?

When we encounter obstacles in life, we have a few choices. Many choose to give up at this point. Others may set out 
with a new plan. A Stoic would be resourceful and find an advantage within the obstacle.

### Conclusion

Part of Stoicism is finding ourselves. Using our strengths is easy, but using weakness to our advantage requires 
resourcefulness.
