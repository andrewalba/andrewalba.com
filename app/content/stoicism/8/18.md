    - quote:
        content: "A good person is invincible, for they don't rush into contests in which they aren't the strongest. If you want their property, take it â€” take also their staff, profession, and body. But you will never compel what they set out for, nor trap them in what they would avoid. For the only contest the good person enters is that of their own reasoned choice. How can such a person not be invincible?"

Why would anyone bite off more than they can chew? Some may choose this route because they want to micro-manage. Some 
may want to be helpful and are unable to say "no" when asked.

### Conclusion

Epictetus is reminding us to pick our battles wisely. Use our reasoned choice to determine what we can and can not do. 
Be efficient with your time. If we take the time and effort to choose wisely, we will become invincible.
