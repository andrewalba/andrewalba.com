Marcus Aurelius is reminding us not to wait until conditions are perfect. Perfect may never happen.

### Conclusion

We have an opportunity every day to make the world a little better place. We don't need to wait until we have more money 
or time. We can start small. Start with picking up a piece of litter. Buy someone a cup of coffee. Allow someone to 
merge in front of you.

Don't let your ego or excuses from starting today.
