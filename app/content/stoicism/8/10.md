All or nothing. If you read social media today, we split the conversations between the left and the right. The current 
presidential administration will save us all or doom us all. COVID-19 is a wake-up call or a hoax.

Allowing this type of thinking leads to frustration. Neither side is perfect. Both sides fated for misfortune.

### Conclusion

We are human. We will fail to see the real issue or understand the real solution. It is our pursuit of progress that 
will allow us to succeed. The chase for the truth and knowledge will set us back on the correct course.
