        content: "Anything that must yet be done, virtue can do with courage and promptness. For anyone would call it a sign of foolishness for one to undertake a task with a lazy and begrudging spirit, or to push the body in one direction and the mind in another, to be torn apart by wildly divergent impulses."

Anyone who has started a home improvement project may relate. We are good about completing the laborious duties but 
being unable to finish the job.

When we hit the wall, be prepared to ask, "What is behind my hesitation"?

### Conclusion

Stay focused. Move forward with intent. Perform to the best of your abilities and finish the job.
