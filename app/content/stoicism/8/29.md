We live in a world full of materialism. Young and old alike struggle daily with the *Fear of Missing Out*.

The fall Apple event is around the corner. Millions of people will be upgrading to the latest generation of the iPhone. 
They will be upgrading not because their current phone is unusable, but because it is not *new*.

or do I want the new iPhone? The wealthiest among us are those who covet *less*.
