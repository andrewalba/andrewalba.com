        content: "For nothing outside my reasoned choice can hinder or harm it â€” my reasoned choice alone can do this to itself. If we would lean this way whenever we fail, and would blame only ourselves and remember that nothing but opinion is the cause of a troubled mind and uneasiness, then by God, I swear we would be making progress."

Our authors of {% daily_stoic %} challenge us to make it through an entire day rationalizing events with our reasoned 
choices.

Did your central air unit break down? You've known it was going to need replacing. The air unit is 30 years old. Did the 
dog eat your slipper? It was your fault for not closing your closet door.

### Conclusion

Be accountable. Take responsibility. We know we can't control others, but our reasoned choice can get us through the day.
