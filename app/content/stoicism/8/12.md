Words can be powerful, but often actions speak louder.

As with most studies, we can gather knowledge and write essays with new ideas. Having the fortitude to implement your 
thoughts with actions is what puts you on the path to Stoicism.

### Conclusion

Learning and applying knowledge from 2,000 years ago to our struggles today can be empowering. We need to remember that 
our words should be spoken with actions.
