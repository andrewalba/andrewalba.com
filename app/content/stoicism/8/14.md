        content: "Philosophy isn't a parlor trick or made for show. It's not concerned with words, but with facts. It's not employed for some pleasure before the day is spent, or to relieve the uneasiness of our leisure. It shapes and builds up the soul, it gives order to life, guides action, shows what should and shouldn't be done â€” it sits at the rudder steering our course as we vacillate in uncertainties. Without it, no one can live without fear or free from care. Countless things happen every hour that require advice, and such advice is to be sought out in philosophy."

Studying philosophy is not for parlor tricks. To use what we learned practically. Convert reasoned thought into action.

### Conclusion

The study of philosophy only to impress others during a debate is worthless. Stoicism intends to improve one's self 
through deliberate thought and actions.
