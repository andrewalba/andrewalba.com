For some, it can be easy to give up once we get behind or start to flail. Being a fan of baseball has taught me the best 
games are the ones where your team is behind in the 9th inning, yet they come back to win.

### Conclusion

Such a comeback requires faith. The faith that you will succeed when given an opportunity. Knowing anything humanly 
possible can be done.
