How far do we go to become a Stoic? Do we give away our material possessions and wander the earth? Wouldn't that make us 
better Stoics?

If you purchased your car to impress others, you might be inclined to do this. But a new car does not always mean you 
are materialistic. It may be a practical and solid financial decision.

### Conclusion

The changes we show externally are often superficial. It is the changes that we make inwardly, ones that only we know 
about, that have importance.
