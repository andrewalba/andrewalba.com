        content: "Heraclitus would shed tears whenever he went out in public â€” Democritus laughed. One saw the whole as a parade of miseries, the other of follies. And so, we should take a lighter view of things and bear them with an easy spirit, for it is more human to laugh at life than to lament it."

What good comes from outwardly lamenting about your issues? Has crying ever solved a dilemma?

### Conclusion

Instead of choosing rage, choose to find the humor. While this may be difficult to implement, the response is 
purposeful. Even now, you can recall some past difficulties that you find humorous with time.
