        content: "Won't you be walking in your predecessors' footsteps? I surely will use the older path, but if I find a shorter and smoother way, I'll blaze a trail there. The ones who pioneered these paths aren't our masters, but our guides. Truth stands open to everyone, it hasn't been monopolized."

A tradition wasn't always tradition. At one point, it was a new concept.

A tradition is often comfortable, but we should not oppose trying something new because it is uncomfortable.

### Conclusion

We need to be open. We need to stay on the leading edge of the Paradigm Shift. Stay relevant.
