    - quote:
        content: "Whenever you take offense at someone's wrongdoing, immediately turn to your own similar failings, such as seeing money as good, or pleasure, or a little fame — whatever form it takes. By thinking on this, you'll quickly forget your anger, considering also what compels them — for what else could they do? Or, if you are able, remove their compulsion."

Judging others in haste is a poor decision. We may feel harmed, but often this is only our perception. We struggle to 
empathize.

Before we write off others, think back to a time when we may have inadvertently harmed others. Would we want them to 
judge us on this action alone?

### Conclusion

Remember to be empathetic. Show compassion and forgiveness. Remember back to when you made the same mistake.
