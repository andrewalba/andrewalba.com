Everything needed for our well-being is right before us, whereas what luxury requires is gathered bymany miseries and anxieties. Let us use this gift of nature and count it among the greatest things."

Wealth can be a treacherous course to navigate for most. Fortune can provide comfort, but when we begin to idolize our 
wealth, we fail ourselves.

Someone wealthy is not evil, but they risk becoming a slave to luxury. Can you imagine losing everything overnight? How 
would you survive?

### Conclusion

We need to learn to be pragmatic about our wealth. Our purpose in life should not be to collect the most **things**. 
Many happy people live with much less.
