Growing up in a small town or large city is no excuse for our bad behavior.  A justification such as *"everyone else is
doing it"* or *"it works for them"* reminds us that two wrongs don't make a right.

### Conclusion

We need to adhere to virtue. We need to remain empathetic. We need to live our lives well regardless of our coworkers, 
neighbors, friends, and or family.
