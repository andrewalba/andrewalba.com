    - quote:
        content: "It is said that if you would have peace of mind, busy yourself with little. But wouldn't a better saying be do what you must and as required of a rational being created for public life? For this brings not only the peace of mind of doing few things, but the greater peace of doing them well. Since the vast majority of our words and actions are unnecessary, corralling them will create an abundance of leisure and tranquility. As a result, we shouldn't forget at each moment to ask, is this one of the unnecessary things? But we must corral not only unnecessary actions but unnecessary thoughts, too, so needless acts don't tag along after them."

How do some people get so much done in a day? Neighbors who fill their days with work. They have activities to attend 
for children, keep yards in immaculate shape, and clean dust-free homes.

Finding the time to do what is important can be as simple as setting down your phone. Removing the television from the 
room. Saying no to extra work out of greed.

### Conclusion

We can find the time to do what is most important, by learning to remove what is not important from our lives. When we 
cut out the fluff, we will have more time to focus on what is necessary.
