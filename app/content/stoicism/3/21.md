    - quote:
        content: "People seek retreats for themselves in the country, by the sea, or in the mountains. You are very much in the habit of yearning for those same things. But this is entirely the trait of a base person, when you can, at any moment, find such a retreat in yourself. For nowhere can you find a more peaceful and less busy retreat than in your own soul â€” especially if on close inspection it is filled with ease, which I say is nothing more than being well-ordered. Treat yourself often to this retreat and be renewed."

Vacations, retreats, some plain peace do not have to involve travel. A weekend getaway can recharge us, but Marcus 
Aurelius is reminding us that we can recharge in other ways as well.

### Conclusion

If we take time and reflect inwardly, we can begin to escape. Relax with our eyes closed, taking deep breaths. Hike 
through a tranquil wooded trail. Find ways to tune out the world. Tune out the elements that cause chaos in our minds 
(social media) and find peace.
