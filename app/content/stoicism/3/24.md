Epictetus is instructing us on how to be philosophers. Digesting book after book about philosophy will not make one 
a philosopher. Instead, it is life and the pursuit of knowledge that creates a philosopher.

### Conclusion

It is the choices we make daily. While working, enjoying company, venturing outdoors, interacting with our neighbors, 
hugging someone we love. These experiences allow us to make the most suitable choices and bring meaning to what we have 
learned.
