Another powerful statement from Epictetus. We give up our minds with ease. Instead of having meaningful discussions with 
others, we become zombies with a television, computer, or phone in front of us. We find ourselves judging and gossiping 
about others instead of reflecting internally.

### Conclusion

Our bodies are subject to this world. Our minds are ours to control and should not be squandered. Freedom from 
distraction and exercising of the mind will provide the awareness we need.
