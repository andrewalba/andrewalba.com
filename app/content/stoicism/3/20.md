    - quote:
        content: "I may wish to be free from torture, but if the time comes for me to endure it, I'll wish to bear it courageously with bravery and honor. Wouldn't I prefer not to fall into war? But if war does befall me, I'll wish to carry nobly the wounds, starvation, and other necessities of war. Neither am I so crazy as to desire illness, but if I must suffer illness, I'll wish to do nothing rash or dishonorable. The point is not to wish for these adversities, but for the virtue that makes adversities bearable."
        author: Seneca

The authors of {% daily_stoic %} give some great examples of what Seneca is saying here.

Planning for an event does not always mean we are wishing for the event. At the heart of the quote from Seneca, is that 
we accept the event for what it is.

### Conclusion

While we don't need to wish for disasters and ill will, being prepared and accepting fate can result in a quicker 
response and an outcome more towards our choosing.
