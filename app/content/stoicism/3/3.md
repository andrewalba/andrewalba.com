        content: "These things don't go together. You must be a unified human being, either good or bad. You must diligently work either on your own reasoning or on things out of your control â€” take great care with the inside and not what's outside, which is to say, stand with the philosopher, or else with the mob!"

Epictetus is reminding us of the dichotomy of our nature. We conflict with ourselves with wants, wishes, and anxieties. 
If we let the opposing sides continue at the same time for too long, they will eventually destroy us.

### Conclusion

Epictetus reminds us that we have two choices with vastly different outcomes. Stand with the philosopher and concentrate 
internally or behave like the leader of a mob, willing to conform to every want.
