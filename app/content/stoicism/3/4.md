    - quote:
        content: "The person is free who lives as they wish, neither compelled, nor hindered, nor limited — whose choices aren't hampered, whose desires succeed, and who don't fall into what repels them. Who wishes to live in deception — tripped up, mistaken, undisciplined, complaining, in a rut? No one. These are base people who don't live as they wish; and so, no base person is free."

We have obligations to family and work, but Epictetus is referring to haughty commitments we make. Those actions made to 
dazzle others. Attempts to quench the insatiable desire for *more*.

### Conclusion

Taking inventory of our most precious gift. The gift of time. This should be the measurement to determine which 
activities are obligations. All other activities lead to self-imposed slavery.
