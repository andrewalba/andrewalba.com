    - quote:
        content: "Were you to live three thousand years, or even a countless multiple of that, keep in mind that no one ever loses a life other than the one they are living, and no one ever lives a life other than the one they are losing. The longest and the shortest life, then, amount to the same, for the present moment lasts the same for all and is all anyone possesses. No one can lose either the past or the future, for how can someone be deprived of what's not theirs?"

Profound. When we want more from our past or expect more from our future, we are neglect the existing moment.

Learning from our past allows us to make a better choice in the present, but yearning for the past is futile. Expecting 
more from the future, expecting the future to unfold as we wish makes us selfish.

### Conclusion

Thankfully the present is within our hold. Life is appreciating the moments. The moment will expire shortly. If we can 
enjoy the present, we can learn to live for a lifetime.
