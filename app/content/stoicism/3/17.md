All of these thousands of years and not much has changed. If we only had darker, fuller hair, we will be more 
attractive. If we drive an expensive car, own the most modern iPhone, purchase a large expensive home, we are "better" 
people.

These are all facades of the real person. The true beauty lies outside any vain obsessions and within virtuous choices.

### Conclusion

We need to observe the works, pursuits, and decisions of individuals instead of admiring the facade they choose to 
display to us.
