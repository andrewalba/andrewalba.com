Anti-Intellectualism has been on the rise in this country, and our last president who governed as an anti-intellectual. 
Epictetus statement above probably reflects my opinions best.

Obtaining a degree signals to the world that one has educated themselves. Some will use this piece of paper to justify 
unreasonable decisions. They will become oblivious to nature.

### Conclusion

You do not need to have a formal education to become an intellectual and having a formal education does not make you an 
intellectual. Understanding nature and our proper role within it starts with awareness and reflection. It requires not 
learning once, but constant evaluation every day.
