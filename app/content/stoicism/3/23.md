        content: "The diseases of the rational soul are long-standing and hardened vices, such as greed and ambition â€”they have put the soul in a straitjacket and have begun to be permanent evils inside it. To put it briefly, this sickness is an unrelenting distortion of judgment, so things that are only mildly desirable are vigorously sought after."

Greed. Seneca describes excess eloquently &hellip; *"this sickness is an unrelenting distortion of judgment, so things that 
are only mildly desirable are vigorously sought after."*

### Conclusion

We can be quick to recognize the trait of greed in others but ignore our greed. Upon honest reflection, which *mildly 
desirable things have you vigorously sought after*? We are better served to work on regulating our vices using a 
reasoned judgment, than criticizing the greed of others.
