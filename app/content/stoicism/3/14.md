Delusions that you are smarter, wealthier, and more powerful than others. The egotistical traits hinder any ability to 
discover and develop.

{% blockquote "It is impossible for a person to begin to learn what he thinks he already knows", "Epictetus" %}

An inflated ego hinders the ability to recognize any lack of knowledge. We do not know what we think we know.

### Conclusion

To grow and develop, we need to fight our egos. Meet our self-deception with contempt and hostility. Humbly accept we 
have much to learn.
