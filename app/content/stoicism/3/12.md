        content: "Whenever someone has done wrong by you, immediately consider what notion of good or evil they had in doing it. For when you see that, you'll feel compassion, instead of astonishment or rage. For you may yourself have the same notions of good and evil, or similar ones, in which case you'll make an allowance for what they've done. But if you no longer hold the same notions, you'll be more readily gracious for their error."

Today's lesson is a hard pill to swallow.

Marcus Aurelius is reminding us to consider *the intention* when we are harmed. Was this a malicious wrong done unto us?

Reflecting upon the intention is not difficult, but reconciling with someone who has wronged you can be tough when they 
have strong convictions for their mistake.

### Conclusion

We have the opportunity to be more empathetic and understanding. We may not agree with those who wrong us, but we can 
choose to not be offended or react with hostility.
