        content: "We can remove most sins if we have a witness standing by as we are about to go wrong. The soul should have someone it can respect, by whose example it can make its inner sanctum more inviolable. Happy is the person who can improve others, not only when present, but even when in their thoughts!"

Cato was a well-known Stoic philosopher known for taking a stand against Julius Caesar. He paid for those actions with 
his life, but his moral stand was revered for generations after.

### Conclusion

Seneca tells us to find that noble person who will be our compass. Someone who will bear witness to our ways. Who will 
not hesitate to scold us when we wander from virtue.

A model like Cato can guide us to live faithfully. In turn, we can serve as a near model of Cato for someone else.
