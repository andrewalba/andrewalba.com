We rely on our senses to survive. Driving a vehicle requires we *see* obstacles and hazards. Being caught off guard, not 
*seeing* another car approaching. We can also *see* impediments that do not exist.

For these reasons, we need to avoid the hubris of trusting our senses. Avoid rushing to conclusions. Test our 
assumptions and use reason to come to the correct decisions.
