        content: "If you should ever turn your will to things outside your control in order to impress someone, be sure that you have wrecked your whole purpose in life. Be content, then, to be a philosopher in all that you do, and if you wish also to be seen as one, show yourself first that you are and you will succeed."

Why do we change our natural behaviors to gain favor? What makes us covet the opinion of others over our own? Why do we 
find it difficult to not conform?

Delving further and being honest, most conformity and trends are short-lived. The real cool kids are the ones that ran 
against the grain.

### Conclusion

Trying to impress others will only drive you to insanity. We can find tranquility and assurance by being true to 
ourselves.
