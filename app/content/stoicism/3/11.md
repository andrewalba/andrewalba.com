Epictetus was an expert on slavery. Be sure to heed his words.

Wealth and fame are desired, but we rarely look at the cost to sustain a life of riches and glory. These amenities 
require hard work or treachery. Long hours and demands from others to support the lifestyle.

### Conclusion

The road towards excess and pleasure will lead us to become prisoners of our own making. Is that really what we want for 
ourselves? Or can we take inventory of what we have now and be happy?
