A wonderful reminder from Marcus Aurelius that those feelings of frustration, of being overwhelmed are manifested 
internally.

Externally, our work can is what it is. We allow the emotions to eat at us inside. Having the knowledge that we can 
control the emotions within gives us a mechanism to cope.

### Conclusion

We can't blame our boss or coworkers for our stresses at work. We can't blame our spouse or parents for our stresses at 
home. The cause of these emotions lies within us.
