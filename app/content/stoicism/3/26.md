What are the influences for our ruling reason? That is what Marcus Aurelius is asking himself.

Yesterday Epictetus reminded us that philosophy requires life experience. Today Marcus Aurelius reminds us to desire 
knowledge and truth.

### Conclusion

Understanding our ruling reason is important and understanding who is pushing the knowledge is important too.
