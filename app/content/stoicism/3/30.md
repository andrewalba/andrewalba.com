        content: "Hurry to your own ruling reason, to the reason of the Whole, and to your neighbor's. To your own mind to make it just; to the mind of the Whole to remember your place in it; and to your neighbor's mind to learn whether it's ignorant or of sound knowledge â€” while recognizing it's like yours."

We fail ourselves by not making choices based on reason. We become victims of our desires and inclinations.

### Conclusion

We can set ourselves up for success using conscious thought and reason with our choices. Even when we are not 
successful, we will rarely regret a decision made with deliberate thought.
