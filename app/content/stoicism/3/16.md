The ability to think, understand and form judgments. The ability to reason is an important gift, and yet we fail to 
utilize our ability to the fullest.

### Conclusion

We should be grateful for the blessing of reason. The gift provides us a method to become better. We can use the gift to 
change the circumstances for us and those around us. Our capacity to reason is a powerful capability that we must not 
squander.
