My initial reaction to the words of Epictetus was that he was asking us to lower the bar.

The authors of The Daily Stoic tell us there are two ways to become wealthy. We can either get all that we want or we 
can want everything we have. We can apply this thought towards freedom.

### Conclusion

Learning to be content with what we have provides freedom. We are no longer working hard for "more", but instead 
**living** with what we have.
