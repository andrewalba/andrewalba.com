        content: "So, concerning the things we pursue, and for which we vigorously exert ourselves, we owe this consideration â€” either there is nothing useful in them, or most aren't useful. Some of them are superfluous, while others aren't worth that much. But we don't discern this and see them as free, when they cost us dearly."

Seneca is providing a powerful reminder. Society has been programmed us to hoard. Clothes. Electronics. Luxuries. 
Wealth. The true cost of our accumulations can be hidden. Cost such as storage, maintenance, repairs, insurance. The 
toll on our sanity.

### Conclusion

Take inventory of all your possessions. Ask yourself, *Do I need this? Is this unnecessary? What is the true cost of 
this?* When we learn the true cost, we can begin to eliminate the superfluous.
