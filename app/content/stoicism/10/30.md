I started this journey into discovering Stoicism after hearing one of the authors of :daily-stoic on a podcast that 
I enjoy. The message resonated with me and having never heard of Stoicism, I was intrigued to learn more.

I decided that this was a philosophy that I wanted to learn and apply to my life. I purchased two of the authors books
about Stoicism and decided to commit to learn daily.

### Conclusion

After reading today's message, my thought is that I need to make more time in my day to learn and implement Stoicism 
into my life. If I can schedule eight to ten hours a day for work, I should be able to schedule another hour a day to 
learn about Stoicism.
