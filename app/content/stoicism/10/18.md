As usual, I read the words of Marcus Aurelius several times and found in this case the message was simple and 
obvious.

Then I read The Daily Stoics authors message, which was to flip this around.

How often have I been the wolf. I had to hang my head in shame. What is in my natural programming that I can enjoy 
being with family or friends, then gossip about them as soon as we part? Such a wolf move.

The true message of Stoicism is about being virtuous. About being true to not only others but yourself. Such a great
reminder whenever I feel I have been slighted by family or friends.
