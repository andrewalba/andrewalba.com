This daily reading came at an important time. This message is simple to read and hear, but can be much more difficult to 
put into action. I have found myself jealous of a co-workers opportunity on more than one occasion. When watching 
others achieve success, my small mind believes that I will be left with less.

This lesson calls attention for my need to cheer (and cheer loudly) the successes of those near me. Jealousy can be hard
to contain. I need to find away to put an end to my petty envy and materialism.
