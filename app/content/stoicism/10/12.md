Powerful yet simple. Love. It is what my God commands of me. To love.

**Hate** can be seen so readily in many places in 2020, but **LOVE** has escaped us.

Reading this short meditation shared by Seneca, several times, I reflect on the few words. I am struck by the thought of 
how much energy we employ to **hate**. **Love** on the other hand can be exercised with such little effort. Why is that?

Why do we have the need to *hate* those that do not agree with us politically? Why do we show little tolerance to those
who are not like us? We spend so much effort *hating* to what end? What do we gain?

No one persons political beliefs changed through another person's hatred towards them. We learn nothing about our 
neighbors through bigotry. Love thoughâ€¦ through love, we can change minds. Love can bring neighbors from 
different backgrounds together in community.

Love. Love. Love.
