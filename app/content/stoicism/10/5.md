My first lesson in Stoicism and the short sentence hits the bullseye with me. To count how many times I let my tongue 
speak such evil and wicked words only to feel the sting of guilt later.

This first lesson is a great reminder that I when I am pushed, when I have become upset, my first reaction should not be
to speak. I need to keep quiet and let my mind calm so that I might find the wise and measured response required.
