      content: "You have proof in the extent of your wanderings that you never found the art of living anywhere—not in logic, nor in wealth, fame, or in any indulgence. Nowhere. Where is it then? In doing what human nature demands. How is a person to do this? By having principles be the source of desire and action. What principles? Those to do with good and evil, indeed in the belief that there is no good for a human being except what creates justice, self-control, courage and freedom, and nothing evil except what destroys these things."
      author: Marcus Aurelius

*What is the meaning of life? Why do I exist?* These are questions that I assume we all ponder at some points  in our 
lives. 

While reading Marcus Aurelius words and then the words of the author :daily-stoic, I also found an interesting 
interpretation of this daily message. The reflection was from the viewpoint of an atheist. This was interesting as it 
was from a view-point that was 180 degrees from my reflection. My background has always made me question my existing as
a Christian.

Our conclusions may not be identical, but they are similar. It is *our lives* that answer. The blessings that I receive 
and attribute to my faith are not to be horded. I need to **always** share my blessings! I can find the answers to my 
existence by living a faithful life. Share my blessings. As the author of :daily-stoic shares *"… by embodying the 
self-evident principles of justice, self-control, courage, freedom, and abstaining from evil."*
