"It is what it is"

My wife likes to use that saying often and even has a nice metal sign with the saying hanging on the wall. It is a 
slogan  that I found myself repeating. That was until about a month ago.

I am making my own mantra based on my wife's statement.

"It is what you make of it"

That is what Seneca reminds me of in today's reading. I have the power to determine how an event will affect me.

One skill I am still trying to learn is to not be so *hasty* in my judgements. My ignorance and or hubris will often be 
quick to be negative. This makes me culpable for my poor behavior that might follow.

The good news is that I have learned that I can *find calm seas* when I am slow to react. Be patient. Observe. Measure 
my reaction. That is how you find the *fair weather and a safe port*.
