While I don't agree with the authors' assessment with regard to original sin, I am sympathetic to the notion that 
original sin can appear to weigh down humankind. The days lesson makes some important points. One ideas stands out to me 
as an optimist. The author points out that at our core, we want to be virtuous. It is our cultural inventions that 
usually serve some selfish interest that conflicts with what is most beneficial to the common good of everyone.

# Conclusion

We are not born evil. Corruption is not innate. It is the result of fostering untrue or inaccurate ideas. One way to 
grapple this evil is to use philosophy to ground us, stripping away our false ideals and bringing us back to a state of 
loving-kindness.
