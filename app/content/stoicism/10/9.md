I remember joking with the guys when I was younger and going out to mingle at bars. There were certain ladies there
that I was not attracted to at the time because I had *a high standard*, but by the end of the night my standard was
not nearly as high as it was at the start of the night. Immature and ignorant, I know.

I never thought about *standards* other than at a high level. It is interesting to be given examples of simple 
opportunities that involve a standard I miss every day. Brushing my teeth, choosing my friends, losing my temper,
interactions with my dogs, conversations with my children, etc. All of these examples have a *standard* that applies, 
but I rarely think about what that *standard* is and instead, base the standard on my actions (or better inaction).

Epictetus reminds us to examine our standards, but more importantly **uphold** our standards. Having a standard is not 
enough. We need to take action to preserve our standards and avoid falling short.   

I believe the authors of {% daily_stoic %} nail the point with the following.

> Not, *I want to do good* - that's an excuse. But, *I will do good in this particular instance, right now*. Set a 
> standard; hold fast to it. That's all there is.
