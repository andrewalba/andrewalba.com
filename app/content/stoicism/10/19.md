Replacing a bad habit with a good habit is not a novel idea. The challenge in my opinion requires that you first 
identify the bad habit, when you are participating in the bad habit,  and then finding a **good** habit to replace the 
**bad** habit with.

For me, I might begin to procrastinate, but not recognize that I have been procrastinating for some time. The faster 
that I identify that I am participating in the bad habit, the faster I can employ the counterforce.

After reading this, I will need to try to identify my usually bad habits and put a plan of action in place to counter 
the bad habit with a good habit. This will not be a one time discovery, as bad habits can develop over time, so 
reviewing my habits should be an ongoing process.
