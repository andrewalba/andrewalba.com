title: Honesty As Our Default

  - quote:
      content: "How rotten and fraudulent when people say they intend to give it to you straight. What are you up to, dear friend? It shouldn’t need your announcement, but be readily seen, as if written on your forehead, heard in the ring of your voice, a flash in your eyes—just as the beloved sees it all in the lover’s glance. In short, the straightforward and good person should be like a smelly goat—you know when they are in the room with you."

It is interesting I have heard and used these empty expressions in the past and never put as much thought into 
them as I am now. If someone is truly virtuous and honest, a preface such as *I'll be honest…* or *No disrespect 
but…* would be unnecessary. We would already respect and value the opinion of the honest person.

I want to note my love for Marcus Aurelius analogy that a **"…the straightforward and good person should be like a 
smelly goat—you know when they are in the room with you."** What a wonderful mental picture it paints for me.

Goal going forward is not only to be honest, but build a reputation of honesty that everyone will come to expect and
respect. I want to be a smelly goat.
