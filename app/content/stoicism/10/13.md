      content: "How much better to heal than seek revenge from injury. Vengeance wastes a lot of time and exposes you to many more injuries than the first that sparked it. Anger always outlasts hurt. Best to take the opposite course. Would anyone think it normal to return a kick to a mule or a bite to a dog?"

I often read these short meditations over several times, letting the message sink in. It helps me think and reflect. 
After my first reading, I couldn't think of a time when I acted out vengefully. After my second reading I felt shame as 
I often think vengefully.

"I'll get you for this." While I might not say that out loud, it is in my heart. It is also the worst possible response.

Seneca's sense of humor is also wise. "Would anyone think it normal to return a kick to a mule or a bite to a dog?"

Christ reminds us with his Sermon on the Mount. "So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you". 
Learn to be the better man.

If someone treats me dishonestly, my dishonest reaction only keeps the circle connected and now everyone *is* a liar.

The author of {% daily_stoic %} provides some great advice. "…let’s seek to be better than the things that disappoint 
or hurt us." We can be the positive, honest example for others to follow.

The thought of living a virtuous and just life should give us peace. Why shouldn't we be striving for more peace in our 
life.
