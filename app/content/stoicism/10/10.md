      content: "Leave the past behind, let the grand design take care of the future, and instead only rightly guide the present to reverence and justice. Reverence so that you’ll love what you’ve been allotted, for nature brought you both to each other. Justice so that you’ll speak the truth freely and without evasion, and so that you’ll act only as the law and value of things require"

This meditation unpacks a few messages in one. We start by remembering that the past is the past. There is no sense in
dwelling on our mistakes, but instead we need to use them as examples and move on. And when we move on, we *let the
grand design take care of the future*? Yeah, we don't need to plan every moment going forward but instead plan 
realistically for what our skills and talents alot us.

#### Reverence

Make realistic plans using the skills and talents God has provided us. And understanding our short comings is important 
as well, as we need to learn to let others help us fill those gaps.

I also feel this can be taken a step further (not sure Marcus Aurelius was going here) and remember that we should not
covet, but enjoy and embrace **our** blessings [skills and talents].

#### Justice

Justice begins with being honest and humble with ourselves about our strengths and weaknesses. Refrain from pretending
to know everything. Use our skills with pride, but have the dignity to know when to say "I don't know" or "can you
help me?". 

When I think of "*speak the truth freely and without evasion*" - I think - don't change the narrative for your own 
benefit or for the benefit of others. Justice is about being open and honest and humble.
