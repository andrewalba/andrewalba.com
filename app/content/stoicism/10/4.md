The notion that we are a bee in the hive should not make you feel insignificant. Instead, it should remind you that we 
are a part of a community.

### Conclusion

For this reason, we as a community should focus on what makes sense for the whole and not the individual. We should 
champion causes that benefit us all and steer clear of causes that benefit the status quo.
