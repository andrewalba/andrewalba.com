      content: "People aren’t in awe of your sharp mind? So be it. But you have many other qualities you can’t claim to have been deprived of at birth. Display then those qualities in your own power: honesty, dignity, endurance, chastity, contentment, frugality, kindness, freedom, persistence, avoiding gossip, and magnanimity."

Today's reading was a lesson in humility of sorts. Who doesn't want to be *the best* at a particular task.

Having a competitive spirit and growing old, I have come to realize, I will not be faster, smarter, better looking then 
everyone. In all honesty, growing older has removed most of my confidence. Perhaps you could argue I was over confident 
as a young man. That same confidence no longer exists.

It is a great comfort to read today's lesson and realize that even though my *natural gifts* may be lacking, I still 
have the ability to build on simple traits that make me a good person.

I can *choose* to be honest. It is my *choice* to be dignified, to endure, to be happy. It is *my decision* to be 
thrifty, to be kind to everyone around me, and to be chase.

The books writers point out that these traits "*are the result of effort and skill*" and should be more impressive to 
those who know me.
