The authors of {% daily_stoic %} point out that some people invest their wealth in assets such as property or the 
financial market, while others choose to invest in connections or achievements. Seneca tells us we should also invest in 
ourselves to become solid and rational.

Our assets, connections, and achievements can all vanish within a disaster. At such time, our moral character does not 
disappear. Our wisdom endures.

### Conclusion

Don't forget to invest in yourself, for you are your most stable and valuable asset.
