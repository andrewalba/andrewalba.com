Took some time and help from the authors of :daily-stoic for me to understand today's lesson.

The simple message is that we need human contact to live life to the fullest. Even the introvert depends on others for 
life.

It is interesting to think that in the year 2020, with a plethora of mediums to interact, meaningful communication is 
still a struggle. Social media is full of trolls. Politics have polarized the masses. Civility is in crisis.

Technology has allowed us to use language such as *"loser"*, *"fat pig"*, *"dumb as a rock"* and *"thugs"* without 
looking at the individual being addressed. It is hard to believe this would be the same language used when sitting 
across from that same person.

We need to schedule less time with our technology and more time in the presence of family and friends. With COVID-19 this 
task is even more daunting, but ever necessary.

### Conclusion

No man/woman is an island. We need to restore a social contract and increase civility between one another. It is time to 
make more time to communicate directly with others.
