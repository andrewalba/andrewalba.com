As the authors of {% daily_stoic %} points out, this sentence is haunting knowing the fate of Seneca.

His message was simple. Today we might say *"what comes around, goes around"* or *"karma is a bitch"*.

When I look back at my life, there are not many instances that I feel I have acted immorally. The more I reflect my 
biggest regrets are actions not taken or words not spoken. Occasions where I have witnessed injustice and decided not to 
speak or act.

### Conslusion

We all sin. We take shortcuts. We tell little white lies. We are judgmental of others. We turn a blind eye.

While these acts may seem trivial at the time, they can hurt others and end up haunting your soul.
