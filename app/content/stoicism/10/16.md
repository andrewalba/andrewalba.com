But other dim and lazy types, hindered by bad habits, must have their rusty souls constantly scrubbed down…. The weaker sorts will be helped and lifted from their bad opinions if we put them in the care of philosophy’s principles."

Had to giggle a little as I tried to read through this meditation. I don't feel I am of an *exceptional mind* nor am I 
*dim and lazy type*. **Hindered by bad habits** for sure.

Thankfully I have others in my life that have provided me with good examples. Family. Leaders. Wife.

I have found that Stoicism compliments my faith. I can be a good steward of my church by example. I can be a good 
example studying my religion and stoic philosophy.
