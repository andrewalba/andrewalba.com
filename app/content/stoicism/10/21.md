      content: "Such behavior! People don't want to praise their contemporaries whose lives they actually share, but hold great expectations for the praise of future generationsâ€”people they haven't met or ever will! This is akin to being upset that past generations didn't praise you."

*Legacy*. Do people actually worry about their legacy? Isn't legacy just a fascination of the powerful and famous?

Today's devotion reinforced the thought that being the best person I can be **today** was the most important thing I can 
do. Another thought came about after reading several times. The thought of *why* I should be a virtuous person today.

There should be no agenda for being virtuous. There should be no end-game. No expectations that I will benefit later.

There are times that I tell myself that if I am virtuous, I will be rewarded. That is an assumption that will eventually 
fail me.

This was a nice reminder that I need to be a better person without an agenda. To be a better person to live my best 
life.
