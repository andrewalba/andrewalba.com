      content: "The best and the greatest number of authors have asserted that philosophy consists of three parts: the moral, the natural, and the rational. The first puts the soul in order. The second thoroughly examines the natural order of things. The third inquires into the proper meaning of words, and their arrangements and proofs which keep falsehoods from creeping in to displace truth."
      author: Seneca

The three parts - the moral, the natural, and the rational - have one aim.

That is a lot to digest.

Seneca tells us *the moral* puts our soul in order. Such a simple approach to explain how morality defines us. While we 
may have differing opinions of morality, this should still apply to all.

Seneca explains that *the natural* examines the natural order of things. Questions. Curiosity. A strong desire to know 
or to learn something.

Finally, Seneca defines *the rational* which at a high level is the search for the truth.

My opinion of today's society is we are deficient in all three parts. 

We are trying to put **others** souls in order while ignoring *our own* moral direction. We are devoid of conversations 
where we can ask questions such as "Why?" We live in an age where we "repost" without asking questions.

The most alarming is that the rational part of our lives appears to be missing altogether. We accept falsehoods and 
half-truths as facts. We don't take the time to measure answers and apply proofs. 

This is why I enjoy studying Stoicism. It is a gentle reminder to be moral, be curious and search for truth and reflect 
all three parts towards those in your life.
