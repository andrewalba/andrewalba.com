Wait... what? Sweat the small stuff?

Like water, we are tempted to take the path of the least resistance. The problem is that over time we find we have 
created a valley we can not escape from.

We are not good people because someone says we are a good person. Our righteous actions make us good people.

### Conclusion

We are the sum of all of our choices. Today choose what is right and not what is easy. Your hard work and good choices 
will ultimately define you.
