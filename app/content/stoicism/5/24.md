Can you make your good fortune? Yes, you can!

Many will say if you "work hard, and you can have the American Dream". I say poppycock.

Good fortune requires hard work, **preparation**, and **opportunity**.  Opportunities can present themselves, but if we 
are not prepared, we fail to secure good fortune.

### Conclusion

Arrange for something better. Prepare by doing the right thing at the right time. Make your good fortune.
