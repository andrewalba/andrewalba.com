Spending time trying to impress others is time wasted. Stoicism reminds us often how we should not worry about things 
that are not in our control.

### Conclusion

We risk losing what is important when worrying about what people think about us. We need to stay true to our values. Our 
lives should be spent trying to do what is right.
