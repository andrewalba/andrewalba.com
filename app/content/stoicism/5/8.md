Reflecting on today's message, it is easy to suggest Stoicism looks at the world as either black or white. Stoicism is 
much deeper than that.

We often contemplate a situation and make choices based on what is good for us. Our choices should be based on what is 
*"good"* and *"right"* morally and not our exclusive benefit


### Conclusion

Epictetus gets to the brass tacks. We need to ignore our wants and desires. We need to choose good and right and make 
that our focus.
