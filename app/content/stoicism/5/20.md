        content: "What's the point of having countless books and libraries, whose titles could hardly be read through in a lifetime. The learner is not taught, but burdened by the sheer volume, and it's better to plant the seeds of a few authors than to be scattered about by many."

The ability to consume information has never been as comprehensive as today. Our phones allow us to request knowledge 
and instantaneously examine the results. "Jack of all trades, master of none."

With this freedom, comes great danger. The risk of following a rabbit hole within the internet consuming information. 
Engrossing knowledge that has no benefit to one's life.

### Conclusion

We should focus on the precious resource of time. Working towards consuming information that benefits our life and using 
the rest of our time acting on that knowledge.
