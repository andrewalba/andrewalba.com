While not directly related to today's message, an alarming trend that I have seen is a growing number of individuals who 
have no empathy. Without empathy, they are unable to feel guilt, shame, or remorse.

I don't completely agree with the author's assertion that guilt is worse than jail. I would perhaps rephrase to say 
guilt is worse than an admission of wrongdoing.

### Conclusion

Feeling guilty requires empathy. It is empathy that makes us a redeeming individual. We should have a curriculum 
regarding empathy in grade school. The ultimate hope that wrongdoing would decrease if we had more empathetic people in 
the world.
