Occupying our thoughts with our work provides several benefits. The hard work and toil provide a sense of 
accomplishment. It allows us to focus our energies away from the messages of advertising. We no longer find ourselves 
trying to keep up with the Jones'.

### Conclusion

Being active. Working. We shed the excessive baggage. We discover what comforts our soul. We earn our happiness.
