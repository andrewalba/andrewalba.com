No one has been more guilty of this than I. You can often hear someone says they want to be successful. Do you hear 
about the detailed plans for success? Do you witness the actions taken towards success?

### Conclusion

Words alone can be empty. Words with a well-thought-out plan and actions that follow through on the plan... that is how 
success is achieved.
