The bucket lists. Often people will have bucket lists that include crazy adventures like bungee jumping or skydiving. 
These are not bad activities to want in life, but they are not necessary to be **living**.

We have the opportunity every day to live through simple acts. We can decide to take a hike after dinner. Decide to 
ignore a person who cuts in line at the store. Be kind to a stranger.

### Conclusion

Emptying ourselves into the present allows us to look back and understand just how well we lived.
