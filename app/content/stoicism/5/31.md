A favorite passages from Meditations. Here the emperor of Roman empires is writing a note to himself, "remember who you 
want to be". the harsh words I would write to myself? "Don't be a dick."

### Conclusion

The message is clear. Stop excusing bad behavior. Be empathetic. Be generous. Be a good person.
