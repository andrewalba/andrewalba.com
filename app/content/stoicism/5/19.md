        content: "That's why the philosophers warn us not to be satisfied with mere learning, but to add practice and then training. For as time passes we forget what we learned and end up doing the opposite, and hold opinions the opposite of what we should."

Few people can learn a sport in a few minutes and become masters. One must learn the rules and strategies. Then learn 
how to implement those strategies through practice and discipline. Step away from the sport a few months or longer, and 
you need to repeat some of these steps.

### Conclusion

Stoic philosophy is no different. Reading about stoicism does not make you a Stoic. Practice, reflection, and a thirst 
for more philosophy are required. Digest, train, reflect and then start it all over again in the morning.
