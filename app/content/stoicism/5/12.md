Giving someone a kind remark is not difficult. Saying kind words to another can warm your soul. Responding to hate with 
kindness initially feels impossible.

For some, responding with kindness is not difficult because their heart is open. For others, we know we have wronged 
someone, and we will defend ourselves, but we will not with kind words.

### Conclusion

Living in a society with kindness sounds much better than living in one with cruelty. Don't be a shallow person. Don't 
be nasty, petty, or cruel. Your kindness makes you strong. Use it.
