        content: "Don't set your mind on things you don't possess as if they were yours, but count the blessings you actually possess and think how much you would desire them if they weren't already yours. But watch yourself, that you don't value these things to the point of being troubled if you should lose them."

The tenth commandment.

{% blockquote "You shall not covet your neighbor’s house. You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or his male or 
female servant, his ox or donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.", "Exodus 20:17" %}

### Conclusion

Learning to appreciate what we already have, is a step closer to obeying this commandment. Preparing yourself to live 
without those items you appreciate is a step even further. Savor what is already yours and let that character control 
your actions.
