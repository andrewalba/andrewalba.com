        content: "Show me someone sick and happy, in danger and happy, dying and happy, exiled and happy, disgraced and happy. Show me! By God, how much I'd like to see a Stoic. But since you can't show me someone that perfectly formed, at least show me someone actively forming themselves so, inclined in this way. &hellip; Show me!"

In Christianity, we hear many who strive to be "Christ-like". This is an impossible mission. So too, the endeavor to be 
a Stoic is impossible.

Aiming high, knowing we will not reach our mark, is not without merit. We can still raise ourselves. We may never 
arrive, but we will become better by just trying.

### Conclusion

A Stoic will learn further tomorrow. Will be charitable tomorrow. Will make the right decision tomorrow. The journey to
becoming a Stoic never ends.
