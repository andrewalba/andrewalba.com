        content: "Let us therefore set out whole-heartedly, leaving aside our many distractions and exert ourselves in this single purpose, before we realize too late the swift and unstoppable flight of time and are left behind. As each day arises, welcome it as the very best day of all, and make it your own possession. We must seize what flees."

Kill your clone!

An interesting metaphor for daily improvement. In summary, killing your clone requires making the most of your day.

Imagine at midnight you are cloned. Within 24 hours you will need to fight your clone to the death. Your goal is to 
improve past your clone or die. You can improve physically and or mentally. You only need to be an iota better than your 
clone.

### Conclusion

How will you become better before you face your clone? Will you eat healthier? Exercise? Read a book? Will you have 
done nothing before you battle your clone?
