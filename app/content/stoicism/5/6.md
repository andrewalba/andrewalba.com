    - quote:
        content: "Then what makes a beautiful human being? Isn't it the presence of human excellence? Young friend, if you wish to be beautiful, then work diligently at human excellence. And what is that? Observe those whom you praise without prejudice. The just or the unjust? The just. The even-tempered or the undisciplined? The even-tempered. The self-controlled or the uncontrolled? The self-controlled. In making yourself that kind of person, you will become beautiful â€” but to the extent you ignore these qualities, you'll be ugly, even if you use every trick in the book to appear beautiful."

Some time ago my wife, and I watched a show which I initially thought was ridiculous. The show had professional 
counselors interview individuals to find their **perfect match**. A select few were chosen, and those couples were 
married without meeting each other first. The show chronicled the joys along with the trials and tribulations that 
ensued.

I had an interesting observation while the show progressed. As we began to learn the true nature of the couples, the 
least outwardly attractive couples became the most attractive couples.

### Conclusion

Our ability to see can blind us to authentic beauty. We jump to conclusions based on visual aesthetics, neglecting our 
other senses. To determine true beauty, we must use all of our senses.
