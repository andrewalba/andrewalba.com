    - quote:
        content: "Those obsessed with glory attach their well-being to the regard of others, those who love pleasure tie it to feelings, but the one with true understanding seeks it only in their own actions. &#8230; Think on the character of the people one wishes to please, the possessions one means to gain, and the tactics one employs to such ends. How quickly time erases such things, and how many will yet be wiped away."

Why do we do, what we do? This is a great question to ask ourselves often. Why do we stay late in the office most days? 
Why do we volunteer for church? Why donate money to a cause?

If you are staying late to impress your supervisor or co-workers? Are you volunteering at church to dazzle friends? Are 
you donating to awe neighbors? You might want to rethink your actions.

### Conclusion

Expecting laud and honors from our efforts is outside our control. Giving our full effort in hopes to do what is right 
would be more valuable. Our responses are where we can find comfort and resilience to our efforts.
