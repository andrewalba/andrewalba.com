Initially, the focus of this reflection was to be about those who give checks with a lot of zeros, but only an 
infinitesimal portion of their wealth. Reflecting further, it became clear that we also provide celebrity status to many 
people who provide nothing to society.

Society has turned individuals who are obtuse, lewd, and immoral into a celebrity. We are entertained by reality stars 
whose only abilities are to scream vulgar language at one another.

### Conclusion

There are no cameras on those who live a virtuous life. These people are **boring** to us. People who give ten percent 
of their wealth freely to charity, that love their neighbors, that find happiness in simplicity. These people are the 
most impressive.
