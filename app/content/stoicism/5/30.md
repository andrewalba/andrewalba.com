I wonder if I would have learned these lessons from Epictetus when I was in high school. Hundreds of years later, we are 
still making assumptions that the hardest workers are in the office longer.

A wise person would say the best worker is the most efficient. While efficiency is at a high, many are not working 
smarter.

It is time to ask the three "W's". **What**, **why**, and **where**. *What are you doing?*  *Why are you doing what you 
are doing?* *Where is your job/career leading you?*

### Conclusion

Your answers should provide you with a sense of accomplishment and if not, you should stop and re-evaluate what you are 
doing.
