    - quote:
        content: "Every habit and capability is confirmed and grows in its corresponding actions, walking by walking, and running by running &#8230; therefore, if you want to do something make a habit of it, if you don't want to do that, don't, but make a habit of something else instead. The same principle is at work in our state of mind. When you get angry, you've not only experienced that evil, but you've also reinforced a bad habit, adding fuel to the fire."

Habits. When you hear the word do you first think of "bad" habits? Knowing that habits are the product of our habitual 
ideas, we can analyze the character of our thoughts.

### Conclusion

We create our habits. We are the product of our habits. Avoid letting desires and pleasure fuel our actions. Look at 
whom you want to be and fuel the actions to become that person.
