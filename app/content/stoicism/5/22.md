"I am going to be a healthier person... starting Monday". "I am going to start daily bible study... tomorrow". Our best 
intention is to start our goal, but we fail to just begin immediately.

### Conclusion

Today is the best day to start. We don't have to lose 20 pounds today, but we can start the process today. We don't have 
to read the bible in a day, but we can begin the study now.
