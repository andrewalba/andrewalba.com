Unwavering. Abiding. Steadfast. In most contexts, these words convey a deep sense of loyalty. We become enamored and 
make heroes out of professions such as law enforcement, military, firefighters, doctors, and politicians. Do they truly 
all deserve our unwavering support?

{% blockquote "Reflect, then, that your ancestors set up those trophies, not that you may gaze at them in wonder, but 
that you may also imitate the virtues of the men who set them up.","Demosthenes" %}

### Conclusion

A large portion of professionals can be inspirational, but no profession deserves unwavering support. Instead, let us 
give those who inspire the respect they deserve. Let's go beyond appreciating them and look to model our lives after 
them.
