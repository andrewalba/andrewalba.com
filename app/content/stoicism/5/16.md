    - quote:
        content: "If you don't wish to be a hot-head, don't feed your habit. Try as a first step to remain calm andcount the days you haven't been angry. I used to be angry every day, now every other day, then every third or fourth &hellip; if you make it as far as 30 days, thank God! For habit is first weakened and then obliterated. When you can say ‘I didn't lose my temper today, or the next day, or for three or four months, but kept my cool under provocation,’ you will know you are in better health."

Strong relationships. Knowledge. Health.

We don't gain or lose in one fell swoop. It is incremental improvements or failures that determine the overall state.

Epictetus is encouraging us to be consistent. We need to be consistent to be healthy. Fasting for a day does not make us 
healthy as it is not sustainable. Our health is the sum of all the choices we make every hour of every day of every week 
of every year.

### Conclusion

If we want to be successful with our goal, consider all the actions necessary to reach said goal. Start small. I will be 
mindful of my health this hour. Repeat this every hour and had a successful day. Repeat this every hour for many hours 
you will have had a successful week, month, or year.
