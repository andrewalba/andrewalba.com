    - quote:
        content: "Those who receive the bare theories immediately want to spew them, as an upset stomach does its food. First digest your theories and you won't throw them up. Otherwise they will be raw, spoiled, and not nourishing. After you've digested them, show us the changes in your reasoned choices, just like the shoulders of gymnasts display their diet and training, and as the craft of artisans show in what they've learned."

The thrill of gaining new knowledge can be enabling. Our first impulse might be, *"I need to share this with the world"*.

### Conclusion

To prove any new knowledge we need first learn how we can apply and act upon it. This is experience. These actions will 
demonstrate the knowledge more effectively than the ringing of the words in another's ears.
