Do not wrongfully put value on an outward appearance. A collar does not make a priest A stethoscope does not make a 
doctor. A badge does not make a law enforcement officer. Do not provide unwavering support towards a profession, but 
instead provide unwavering support for moral character.

### Conclusion

How do we recognize someone good within their profession? Just look at their character.
