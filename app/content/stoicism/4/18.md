    - quote:
        content: "What is bad luck? Opinion. What are conflict, dispute, blame, accusation, irreverence, and frivolity? They are all opinions, and more than that, they are opinions that lie outside of our own reasoned choice, presented as if they were good or evil. Let a person shift their opinions only to what belongs in the field of their own choice, and I guarantee that person will have peace of mind, whatever is happening around them."

Opinions are our tinted glasses of the world. We can see the truth, but the accuracy is colored by our conviction, 
privilege, and stupidity.

### Conclusion

Imagine the ability to observe without bias. Observe our surroundings broken down to their simplest parts without 
opinion. Be happy and let go of your opinions.
