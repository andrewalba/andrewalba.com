    - quote:
        content: "Make sure you're not made 'Emperor,' avoid that imperial stain. It can happen to you, so keep yourself simple, good, pure, saintly, plain, a friend of justice, god-fearing, gracious, affectionate, and strong for your proper work. Fight to remain the person that philosophy wished to make you. Revere the gods, and look after each other. Life is short â€” the fruit of this life is a good character and acts for the common good."
        author: Marcus Aurelius

History has taught us that wealth, power and fame can consume most good people. The lust for the more occupies every 
decision.

Marcus Aurelius had wealth, power, and fame. His wish was to stay humble, continue with moral character despite all 
temptations.

### Conclusion

Our prayers and reflections should not be wasted on coveting. We should be expressing gratefulness for what has already 
been given. To love what we have and to strengthen our moral character.
