        content: "When it comes to money, where we feel our clear interest, we have an entire art where the tester uses many means to discover the worth &hellip; just as we give great attention to judging things that might steer us badly. But when it comes to our own ruling principle, we yawn and doze off, accepting any appearance that flashes by without counting the cost."

When you sell something valuable, you will be provided a large amount of cash. When we accept payment, we will generally 
count the cash and inspect the notes to ensure authenticity.

We put effort into validating the authenticity of a currency that is the invention of our society, but no effort to 
validating shared thoughts on social media. We blindly accept these assertions without testing for truth.

### Conclusion

Because a majority of people believe, does not make something truthful. We must test these opinions and not act on that 
which is untested.
