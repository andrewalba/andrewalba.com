    - quote:
        content: "Turn it inside out and see what it is like â€” what it becomes like when old, sick, or prostituting itself. How short-lived the praiser and praised, the one who remembers and the remembered. Remembered in some corner of these parts, and even there not in the same way by all, or even by one. And the whole earth is but a mere speck."

Today's lesson is a challenge. A dare to dismantle what we think we know about a subject. To examine the subject from 
different perspectives.

### Conclusion

Empower yourself by questioning traditions. Why do we do this or that? Does this tradition still have meaning? These 
questions may provide a deeper appreciation for a tradition or dispel any need to continue the tradition.
