Marcus Aurelius journaled for himself. He is not asking for us to pay close attention to the words chosen by others, but 
to observe the words we use.

What words did we choose? Did we choose any with prejudice? Are we being positive or negative?

### Conclusion

Becoming a good person requires recognition of damaging behaviors. We are incapable of correcting what we are unable to 
discern.
