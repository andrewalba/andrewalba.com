With time and experience, we begin to understand the arrogance of our opinions. Time puts our opinions to the true test. 
The test of time reveals the absolute truth.

### Conclusion

Philosophy encourages us to challenge our understanding. Question our references and our logic. Stay humble and be 
willing to change our opinions.
