Most who have the luxury of paying taxes will complain about it at some time. When breaking the emotions down, they 
center around greed. While trying to justify my complaints around fairness, there is a fair amount of greed associated 
with my underlying complaint.

Today I am reminded about all the other taxes in life that are not monetary. The tax we face waiting to board our plane. 
The tax that is placed on our relationships by hearsay. The tax of stress that comes with success.

### Conclusion

We are taxed in numerous manners. Paying our taxes and learning to enjoy the gifts already provided is a path for 
happiness.
