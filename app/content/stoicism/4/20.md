        content: "Here's a way to think about what the masses regard as being ‘good’ things. If you would first start by setting your mind upon things that are unquestionably good—wisdom, self-control, justice, courage — with this preconception you'll no longer be able to listen to the popular refrain that there are too many good things to experience in a lifetime."

It is interesting to reflect upon the items we have coveted and the result of acquiring the said item. Did it provide 
happiness or pleasure? Did it satisfy or do we still covet "more"?

### Conclusion

Materialistic things seldom provide us happiness. Virtues such as wisdom, self-control, justice, courage - these 
qualities can and do provide long-term happiness.
