This lesson resonates with me. It provides guilt and shame when looking back at previous thoughts. It also affords 
comfort and forgiveness to know we can change and be better human beings.

Holding on to our beliefs, knowing they will not withstand any test stunts our growth as a person. Openly exposing 
ourselves to wisdom and accepting our past failures puts us on a path of enlightenment.

### Conclusion

When provided proof of shortcomings of our beliefs or actions, we need to be accepting of constructive criticism. 
Acceptance of wisdom allows us to grow and be a better version of ourselves.
