We are reminded that our minds are a vessel that holds our thought. These perceptions mold our emotions, our opinions of 
others, decisions we make today and tomorrow. We should be wary of the knowledge we choose to accept and ignore.

### Conclusion

Marcus chooses the beautiful term "color" to address our bias. The word is poetic and descriptive. Our *"human spirit 
colors our impressions"*, our thoughts filtered by colored lenses. The truth visible to us but biased by our impression.
