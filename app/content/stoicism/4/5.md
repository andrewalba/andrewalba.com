Social media allows us to share a post with a simple click. With a click of the mouse, we are telling the world that we 
share the same sentiment. But have we validated the post properly? *Have we put it through the test? What do we know 
about the original post? What of the person who posted it? What is it about the post that provides strong feelings? What 
is the intended purpose of the post?*

### Conclusion

Before we get carried away with our emotions, we should take a few minutes to question the post. What would make this 
post something we would want to share with our friends and family. As the authors of :daily-stoic says, *"Trust, 
but verify"*
