Everything new and shiny. Even crows find interest in shiny stones and glittering foil. The attraction must be 
instinctual.

Today's reading has me reminiscing. How many people I know will take anything provided to them for *"free"*.  What I 
have learned in the last few months is that nothing is *"free"*. While there may be no cost to acquire, there is a cost 
for maintenance, storage, disposal.

### Conclusion

Not every offer for fortune will end in ruin. We need to be mindful of our desires and not allow them to lead us to 
disaster.
