    - quote:
        content: "Just as what is considered rational or irrational differs for each person, in the same way what is good or evil and useful or useless differs for each person. This is why we need education, so that we might learn how to adjust our preconceived notions of the rational and irrational in harmony with nature. In sorting this out, we don't simply rely on our estimate of the value of external things, but also apply the rule of what is in keeping with one's character."

Are your thoughts and convictions your own? We hear daily from some that we are *"sheeple"*. We are blind followers. Do 
we seek to educate ourselves about the truth or take the word of social media?

### Conclusion

Our character is strengthened with the knowledge that we can not be seduced, bribed, or influenced to come to a 
conclusion that is not our own. We must educate ourselves. We use this wisdom to make a logical and reasonable judgment.
