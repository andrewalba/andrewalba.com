To see an event for what it truly is, we can break it down into simple factual parts. Each part to be examined without 
biased opinions. The event is the sum of these parts.

### Conclusion

*"This will be the end of me. Why is this happening to me?"* These are judgments we have placed on events. The event has 
no intentions. The event (as my wife likes to say) *"is what it is"*. It is our judgments that allow the event to cause 
us to be disturbed.
