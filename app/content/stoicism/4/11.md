Wisdom and debate like arrogance and arguing are also closely related. A true debate requires listening to the other 
party without prejudice. Anything less is just arguing.

### Conclusion

When we are humble and willing to listen to the truths from others, we can grow. We can discover without opinion. We can 
put the other party's thoughts to the test.
