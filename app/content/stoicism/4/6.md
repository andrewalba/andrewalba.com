    - quote:
        content: "When you first rise in the morning tell yourself: I will encounter busybodies, ingrates, egomaniacs, liars, the jealous and cranks. They are all stricken with these afflictions because they don’t know the difference between good and evil. Because I have understood the beauty of good and the ugliness of evil, I know that these wrong-doers are still akin to me…and that none can do me harm, or implicate me in ugliness - nor can I be angry at my relatives or hate them. For we are made for cooperation."

There is no doubt that we will interact with someone who is being a jerk during the day. Co-worker, a friend on social 
media, crazy relative, ourselves. This is why we must prepare ourselves every day.

### Conclusion

Even more important, we should make sure that we respond correctly. React with tolerance, mercy, and understanding.
