We live in a polarized world where others are trying to influence not that their way is better, but that the other way 
is worse. The longer we allow the voices to echo in our ears, the more likely we are to be distracted by the drama and 
conflict.

### Conclusion

We may be unable to escape the voices. We can reject the narrative. We can deliberately revoke the dialog from becoming 
our thoughts.
