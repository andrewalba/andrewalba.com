Watching the stars.

One of the beautiful moments of traveling to rural areas is how the night sky blossoms with stars. We can reflect on the 
enormity of the galaxy that is visible. Our view is infinitesimal compared to the entirety of the universe.  Our life in 
this world is insignificant in comparison to the entire universe.

### Conclusion

Observations of the heavens can be a sound medicine to take in. A sobering reminder of how trivial our concerns are. We 
are, but a spec of dust in nature.
