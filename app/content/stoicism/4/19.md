A powerful Roman emperor quotes the words of a former slave. Both the powerful and the powerless examining the 
importance of checking our impulses.

### Conclusion

We may never experience absolute power, but feeling powerless is likely something we will all experience. Epictetus 
would have known this feeling most of his life. Each situation requires we examine the subject and avoid knee-jerk 
reactions.
