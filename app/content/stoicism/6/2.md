        content: "How beautifully Plato put it. Whenever you want to talk about people, it's best to take a bird's-eye view and see everything all at once — of gatherings, armies, farms, weddings and divorces, births and deaths, noisy courtrooms or silent spaces, every foreign people, holidays, memorials, markets — all blended together and arranged in a pairing of opposites."

Perspective. How poignant message amid today's political climate.

Blessed by modern technology and science, we still have many who interpret the facts to fit their prerogative.

### Conclusion

Free yourself from opinion. Take off the colored lenses of bias. Examine an uncomfortable view and may find new answers 
to old questions.
