Could it be true? Can you live a life with no *problems*?

Stoicism would suggest this is possible. It begins with managing expectations. Learning to accept the unexpected.

The ability to consider the spectrum of outcomes is important as well. Don't put all your eggs in the basket that you 
are expecting. Prepare for the unexpected.

Don't stop there. Have a plan and action for handling the unexpected.



### Conclusion

If we manage our expectations, prepare for the unexpected, and execute our plan for the unexpected, life can be free of 
*problems*.
