Getting swept up with the *Big Picture* can become overwhelming when we are trying to plan and problem solve. Marcus 
Aurelius reminds us to focus on the present when we start becoming overwhelmed.

### Conclusion

There is an interesting balance here. We can become too focused on the present such that we lose sight of the forest 
through the trees. Finding the balance between both allows us to keep moving forward.
