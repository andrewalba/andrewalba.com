Modern life does not offer us as many chances to get out and enjoy a brisk walk. Even more difficult is to find a 
calming location to walk.

Seneca recalls the mending properties of fresh air and light exercise.

### Conclusion

Make the time. Bring some comfortable shoes. Scout for comfortable routes. Go for a walk. Getting out and moving 
nurtures your mind.
