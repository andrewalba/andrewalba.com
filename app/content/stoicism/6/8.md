    - quote:
        content: "You must build up your life action by action, and be content if each one achieves its goal as far as possible â€” and no one can keep you from this. But there will be some external obstacle! Perhaps, but no obstacle to acting with justice, self-control, and wisdom. But what if some other area of my action is thwarted? Well, gladly accept the obstacle for what it is and shift your attention to what is given, and another action will immediately take its place, one that better fits the life you are building."

A benefit of focusing on the small steps and not the distant finish line, we are better equipped to deal with the 
obstacles life throws at us. We can focus quickly and react. We have a better chance to not stumble.

### Conclusion

Life is a marathon. We might measure our progress in miles, but the journey is achieved step by step.
