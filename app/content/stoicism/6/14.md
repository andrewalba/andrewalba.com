    - quote:
        content: "Every event has two handles — one by which it can be carried, and one by which it can't. If your brother does you wrong, don't grab it by his wronging, because this is the handle incapable of lifting it. Instead, use the other — that he is your brother, that you were raised together, and then you will have hold of the handle that carries."

A wonderful sentiment. One can almost be reminded of the saying:

{% blockquote "Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.", "Unknown" %}

### Conclusion

It is important to recognize, trying the other handle is no guarantee of a positive outcome. It does guarantee to change 
our trajectory, taking us on a journey that has not worked.
