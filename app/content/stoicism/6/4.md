We are not alone. Everyone rides the highs and lows on the roller coaster of life. It is not just our generation, but 
also those of all that came before us.

Life can be difficult. When struggling, it might do us well to remember those who came before us and remind ourselves of 
their struggles. Struggles to toil the earth. Perils of crossing rough seas. Fights to survive harsh conditions.

### Conclusion

Understanding the struggles of our ancestors can provide some needed perspective to our issues. Our first-world problems 
will soon feel silly.
