        content: "Don't you know life is like a military campaign? One must serve on watch, another in reconnaissance, another on the front line. &hellip; So it is for us â€” each person's life is a kind of battle, and a long and varied one too. You must keep watch like a soldier and do everything commanded. &hellip; You have been stationed in a key post, not some lowly place, and not for a short time but for life."
