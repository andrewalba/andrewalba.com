        content: "He can't serve in the military? Let him seek public office. Must he live in the private sector? Let him be a spokesperson. Is he condemned to silence? Let him aid his fellow citizens by silent public witness. Is it dangerous to enter the Forum? Let him display himself, in private homes, at public events and gatherings, as a good associate, faithful friend, and moderate tablemate. Has he lost the duties of a citizen? Let him exercise those of a human being."

Is Seneca telling us to lower our standard? No. Seneca is encouraging us to serve where we can.

Growing up, playing professional sports is a dream for many athletes. Only a few will have the physical gifts to 
continue on that path, but we don't have to abandon our dream entirely. Opportunities to manage or scout allow one to 
continue.

### Conclusion

Make a decision not to quit. Be flexible and take advantage of related opportunities. Be willing to toil at a lower 
level.
