        content: "Let Fate find us prepared and active. Here is the great soul â€” the one who surrenders to Fate. The opposite is the weak and degenerate one, who struggles with and has a poor regard for the order of the world, and seeks to correct the faults of the gods rather than their own."

Planning for circumstances outside our control is only part of the solution. To implement any plan, we require actions. 
We need to ensure we have the tools necessary to implement the plan.

### Conclusion

Life is an obstacle course of problems, difficulties, confusion, and disappointments. The course can not be changed, but 
we can do our best to prepare for the course.
