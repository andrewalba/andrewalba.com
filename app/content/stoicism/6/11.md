Here Marcus Aurelius is pointing out that our attitudes and reactions to events can be more harmful than the events 
themselves.

### Conclusion

Keep it simple. When life knocks you down, avoid reacting. Take a moment. Breathe. Ponder the situation. Once you have 
resolved your emotions, make plans to get up and go forward.
