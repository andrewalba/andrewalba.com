Why is it so hard to ask for help? Pride? Masculinity? Shame? What is the reason we decide to flail aimlessly rather 
than request assistance?

Here we have the most powerful man in the world reminding himself to not be ashamed to ask for assistance.

### Conclusion

No one has every tool required to solve every difficulty. There is no need to tackle every problem on our own. If you 
need help, merely ask for help!
