        content: "In this way you must understand how laughable it is to say, 'Tell me what to do!' What advice could I possibly give? No, a far better request is, 'Train my mind to adapt to any circumstance.' &hellip; In this way, if circumstances take you off script &hellip; you won't be desperate for a new prompting."

Plans for the day, week, month, or year can fall short of what the future holds. Stoicism does not ensure we have 
foolproof plans for our future. Instead, Stoicism guides us by encouraging us to adapt and change with our 
circumstances.

### Conclusion

Concentrating on the strategy rather than the tactics. Thirsting for knowledge and learning instead of skipping to the 
answers. Adapting when the script fails.
