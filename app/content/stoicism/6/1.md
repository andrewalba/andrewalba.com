Having a *reverse clause* is not necessarily a *backup plan*. The reverse clause can be thought of as the reasoned next
step. This would replace anger, disappointment, and or rage.

### Conclusion

When life gives us a box of lemons, don't get upset. Don't pout. Don't abandon the box of lemons. Salvage what you can 
from the situation and move forward.
