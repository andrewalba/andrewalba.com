Today marks a milestone in my life. Today is my 50th birthday.  Alive for half of a century. This day comes with a bag 
of mixed feelings.

Todays {% daily_stoic %} reading is an admirable example of recognizing how far I have come. Albeit the title is **No 
Excuses**, the message centers around empathy.

### Conclusion

When we lack empathy, we find convenient excuses to explain our woes or the woes of others. We can all check our egos, 
manage our temper and become caring spirits. Be calm, caring, and empathetic.
