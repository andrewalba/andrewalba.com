If a person carries themselves so, where is there any room for fighting?"

While mulling over this message, thoughts of contentious arguments began filling the mind. Does every political 
conversation require a counterpoint? What is the harm in just listening and not agreeing? What is lost when we say 
nothing, but rather listen?

A contentious conversation does not need a winner. We can listen calmly, patiently, and resist any temptations to fire 
back. There is no need to win every little battle. Pick your battles wisely.
