Our worst critic is often ourselves. Others may view our deeds as a fine work of art, but we see every poor color 
choice, every errant stroke, every missed shadow.

### Conclusion

We can use our self-criticism to be constructive or, we can use our critique to punish ourselves. The choice is ours. 
Hold ourselves to an impossible standard or recognize what went well and where we can improve.
