    - quote:
        content: "While it's true that someone can impede our actions, they can't impede our intentions and our attitudes, which have the power of being conditional and adaptable. For the mind adapts and converts any obstacle to its action into a means of achieving it. That which is an impediment to action is turned to advance action. The obstacle on the path becomes the way."

Our ability to plan will never trump nature's ability to wreak havoc.

{% blockquote "The best laid schemes o’ Mice an’ Men Gang aft agley,", "Robert Burns" %}

A stoic can convert obstacles into opportunities.

If a driver cuts you off, practice forgiveness.

If a coworker has a sick child, it's a chance to be empathetic.

If a hike is longer than expected, it's an opportunity to get stronger.

### Conclusion

Turn obstacles into opportunities. Every difficulty has the potential of advancing you forward in another way.
