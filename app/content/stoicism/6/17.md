Reading this passage from Seneca, the relation to offense and defense was not immediate. Then it became a little more 
clear reading the author's of :daily-stoic notes. Some people try to manipulate **fortune** in their favor, while 
others try to avoid **fortune** all together.

### Conclusion

The choice is ours. Relying on **fortune** feels exhausting and destructive. Avoiding the grip of **fortune** eliminates 
opportunities for material rewards. Which will provide more comfort when your end is near?
