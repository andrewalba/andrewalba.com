The advice from Seneca is reassuring. Growing up, there were many opinions that I formed based on faith and politics.  
With time, I began to question my opinions. In-depth studies of my faith pointed out many inconsistencies with my 
behavior. This new knowledge also put me at odds with my political beliefs.

### Conclusion

We can arm ourselves with knowledge. Seneca is not advocating *wishy-washy* behavior. Seneca is advocating we alter our 
path with deliberate thought and reasoned choice.
