Life is full of setbacks. Blaming others for our misfortune has no benefit. It is energy wasted.

### Conclusion

When we feel wrong, we are only victims if we choose to become victims. Choose to focus on the blessings given to us. Be 
prepared to roll up the sleeves and work hard to improve the situation.
