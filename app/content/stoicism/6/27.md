        content: "How does it help, my husband, to make misfortune heavier by complaining about it? This is more fit for a king â€” to seize your adversities head on. The more precarious his situation, the more imminent his fall from power, the more firmly he should be resolved to stand and fight. It isn't manly to retreat from fortune."
        author: Seneca

The world has its fair share of Jekyll and Hyde's. Neighbors who are outwardly friendly, but behind closed doors cruel 
and controlling. Coworkers go out of their way to be friendly at work only to chastise and belittle family when they get 
home.

### Conclusion

Any amount of stress can expose our true nature. As the world becomes painful to bear, the cracks on our facade appear. 
Adversity reveals our actual personalities.
