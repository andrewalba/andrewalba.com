For those who have grown up with good mentors, it can be difficult to imagine not having a good mentor growing up. How 
can we expect anyone to have morals and virtue?

Seneca's message is that while we are unable to choose our parents, we can choose our role models. The authors of 
:daily-stoic remind us that our role model can be anyone living or dead.

### Conclusion

We must seek out the knowledge. We can learn from our mentor's experience and push forward as an example to our mentor.
