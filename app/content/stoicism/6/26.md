Our lives can be filled with patterns. Those patterns can have a positive or negative net effect on our lives. What if we 
broke those negative patterns?

If our eating regimen results in us gaining weight, what are some changes we can make to the regimen to create a 
positive weight loss? We can reflect on the results a week or two later. Were the changes positive? Can we improve 
further in a healthy manner?

### Conclusion

Sometimes we can simply do *the opposite* to break a habit. Other times that might be extreme, but we can still find 
ways to break the pattern.
