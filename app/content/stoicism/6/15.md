One of the greatest regrets of my youth was that I often dominated all discussions.

The habit made me unbearable to those around me, of this I am sure. More importantly, I now understand just how much I 
could have learned from those around me.

### Conclusion

Before you speak, ask yourself if you are contributing to the conversation or adding to the problem. Listening to 
others. Hear their wisdom. Learn to say less than necessary.
