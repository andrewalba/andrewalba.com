    - quote:
        content: "There is no vice which lacks a defense, none that at the outset isn't modest and easily intervened — but after this the trouble spreads widely. If you allow it to get started you won't be able to control when it stops. Every emotion is at first weak. Later it rouses itself and gathers strength as it moves along — it's easier to slow it down than to supplant it."

A torrent of bad habits. Our habits when left unchecked can sweep us away.

### Conclusion

Seneca is advising we be mindful of checking our behavior. If we can recognize any poor practices when they are still a 
trickle, we can avoid being swept away in a torrent of bad habits later.
