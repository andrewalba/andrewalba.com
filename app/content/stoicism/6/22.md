Habits and failures. Failure has a negative connotation to most, but failure can be useful. We can use our failures as 
lessons and motivations to improve ourselves.

Recognizing our failures without adjusting our habits could be another definition of insanity. For instance, we know we 
tend to gorge, but we continue to dine at the "all-you-can-eat buffet". Knowing you will get angry sitting in traffic, 
yet you never alter your departure time or route.

### Conclusion

Break the pattern. Find alternative routes. The smallest of extra efforts can produce profound effects in the long run.
