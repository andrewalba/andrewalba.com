  - quote:
      content: "Were all the geniuses of history to focus on this single theme, they could never fully express their bafflement at the darkness of the human mind. No person would give up even an inch of their estate, and the slightest dispute with a neighbor can mean hell to pay; yet we easily let others encroach on our lives—worse, we often pave the way for those who will take it over. No person hands out their money to passersby, but to how many do each of us hand out our lives! We’re tight-fisted with property and money, yet think too little of wasting time, the one thing about which we should all be the toughest misers."

This has been one of the more powerful lessons in the last few months. We are reminded how much effort we put towards 
establishing wealth and property, but how little effort we put towards guarding our most precious gift… time.

At this moment I can not help that I feel shame and guilt when I reminisce of time wasted. I would love to lie to myself 
and say I have been better within the last decade, but if I have been more efficient with my time, I've only been 
marginally better.

### Conclusion

While we are all blessed with different gifts as individuals, the one blessing we all share is time. Our priorities
should be to manage our time wisely. We can earn more wealth, purchase more property, but earning more time for our 
lives is just not possible.
