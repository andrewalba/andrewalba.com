This lesson can put a person in their place. Do you always *Super Size* your meal? Do you only enjoy a well crafted 
beer? Do you have disdain for liquor that is not from the top shelf? Will you only purchase specific brands?

Finding the pleasure in the opulence of *things* is likely human nature. In life, indulging in such luxury will not 
bring us lasting happiness.

### Conclusion

When we find ourselves lusting or coveting, we would do well to remember what Seneca is saying. We are mere filters for 
such pleasures.
