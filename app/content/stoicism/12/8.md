The suppressing of emotions has long been a stereotype of Stoicism, but what we have learned is that Stoic philosophy is 
really about acceptance, processing and negotiating our emotionâ€¦ immediately. Putting Stoicism into everyday 
practice will still be a challenge. Notably for someone who was has spent most of his adult life in the midwest.

### Conclusion

Today's exercise is especially important to me. Learning to grieve immediately is a valuable lesson. The faster we
accept the loss, the faster we can mourn and recover. It almost feels callous to write this out like we are a machine.
That is not the intention, but this outlook more of a map of the route to take to recovery.
