I love history. My wife would be the first to advise against going to a history museum with me. I could stay there for 
days just soaking up the historical artifacts. Photos, paintings, writings. Often the creators of those museum pieces 
are prominent persons of that time. Most often the story or image is stored in my mind, but the creator is forgotten.

Marcus Aurelius was one of the most revered rulers in the Roman Empire and even he knew one day he would not be 
remembered. Our fate is no greater or worse.

### Conclusion

Scratching and saving to build up vast amounts of land, wealth and prestige feels vain at this point. We reach a balance 
after which, we have more than we need. Gifting our possessions as a legacy will not ensure we are remembered. For we 
will be forgotten almost as soon as the last person mourns. All of us, rich or poor, celebrity or nobody will fade away 
as those who remember us pass. Chance may allow us to be remembered for a day at most after we are gone.
