No person can be perfect, and the Stoics were aware of this. The Stoics believed that although we are not capable of  
reaching a state of perfection, we should not stop trying to reach perfection. After all, there is so much to gain by 
trying to live a more perfect life.

The philosophy reminds me a little about a mental exercise to kill your clone. Imagine every day we spin off a clone 
of ourselves and within twenty-four hours, we are forced to battle to the death with our clone. In order to defeat our 
clone we only need to have improved ourselves a small fraction more than our clone has for the day.

The point is, each day we should focus on trying to be a better version of the person we were a day ago.

### Conclusion 

If we were to assume that today was our last day, how long could we stay true to perfection within our *ethos*? Could 
we embody this completeness for the entire day? A few hours? What if our life depended upon improving ourselves even 
just a small amount. We can't be perfect, but we can be better. Just trying was enough for the Stoics, and that should 
be well enough for us too.
