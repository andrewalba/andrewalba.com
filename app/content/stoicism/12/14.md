Marcus Aurelius is speaking about his own mortality. Marcus Aurelius is considered one of the greatest Roman leaders, 
but even with all of his accomplishments, he still dealt with anxiousness and vexation. He also knew that he still had 
a chance to make good choices and this could provide some relief.

### Conclusion 

The lesson learned from {% daily_stoic %} is that if we have time left, we should still do all that we can to do good.
We are not our complete versions until the very end. Learning this early on allows us to "enjoy the fruits of the labor
on our character" as the authors mention.
