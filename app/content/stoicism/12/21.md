18,075 days. 433,750 hours. Those are the approximate days and hours lived in my life. How many of those hours were 
spent truly living? What has been the result?

Few us should be happy for all that we have done in our lives. If we are honest, we have wasted our precious gift of 
time on activities less than worthy. Time spent playing video games, at the office trying to impress, bingeing a Netflix 
original series. The list can go on and on.

Our hours are like those sands through the hour glass. One day, the last few grains will disappear from the top 
cylinder. Our life will be extinguished. When that happens, if we were asked, "Hey, did you make the most of it?" what 
would our response be?

Stoic philosophy has shown us that our life is not the accumulation of wealth, or of status or of grand achievements. My 
faith reinforces this teaching. Life is about obtaining the wisdom and insights to make reasoned choices. Choices that 
can reflect how to deal with the daily struggles of life. How to find happiness in life.

### Conclusion

Our journey through life should not be to just live. We should use our wisdom and insights to instead make sure we 
*overflow* our life with **good living**.
