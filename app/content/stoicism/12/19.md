It can be difficult to keep *scale* in mind. One reason, is to provide scale a comparison is needed. A comparison does 
not always have a method to physically apply a measurement, therefore we have to extrapolate.

Using examples where we can visualize the comparison can help emphasize a scale. Marcus Aurelius uses a fairly common 
example with both physical matter and time. Our egotistical nature will often not allow us to recognize that no matter 
how grand or detrimental our thoughts, words or actions might *feel* to us, our role is infinitesimal.

### Conclusion

Applying reasoned choices to our life can result personally in an extreme high or a deep low. When that decision is 
examined at its actual natural scale, the choice at most made a small ripple around us. The ocean of choices that 
surrounds us was likely unaware and will continue to ebb and flow naturally.
