Many people have knowledge, but experiences and knowledge together provide wisdom. So it is true, with age comes wisdom.

This is what comes to mind while reading today's lesson from {% daily_stoic %}. In life, we build our knowledge as we 
mature. With that comes the wisdom from experience. That experience helps us sculpt and shape our life.

### Conclusion

Learning to die well, requires that we first learn to live well. We can do both by remembering our experiences and what 
has been provided from our wise ancestors.
