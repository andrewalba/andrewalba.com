This is a lesson I can attest too.

For most of my life, I have been a passionate person. That is a nice way to say, I was prone to overreact. Zero to blood 
boiling over in the blink of an eye.

Here is the embarrassing part. More often than not, the overreaction was unwarranted. The matter of the moment was
insignificant, my exaggerated responseâ€¦ over the top. Guess who ended up looking like a real ass most the time.

I have learned to take deep breaths, soak up the entirety of the situation. Take some deep breaths and examine possible 
outcomes. Take some deep breaths and look for solutions. Then take some more deep breaths.

### Conclusion

A calm mind is the best listener. A mind that is calm has a better view. A calm mind can find solutions. Don't allow 
your emotions get the better of you. Someone in front of you didn't use their turn signal? Be calm. Death took a friend
or family member? Be at peace. Our calm and reasoned mind can deal with all misfortunes.
