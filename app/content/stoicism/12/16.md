The Stoics warn us of the dangers in placing too much faith in those things we do not control. Epictetus reminds us of 
the one item of our life we do have control of. We have complete control of our reasoned choice.


### Conclusion

We have little control of most matters of our health. We can be of good health one day and terminally ill the next. The 
one area of our life we can control, is our reasoned choice. Reasoned choice can remain even when our bodies fail us. We 
may quit our reasoned choice, but our reasoned choice will never quit us.
