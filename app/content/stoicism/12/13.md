The last few months have made me wonder if I would have welcomed Stoicism when I was younger. I don't know that the 
younger version of myself would have embraced Stoicism, but I wish I would have taken the opportunity to learn more
about the philosophy. I say this because for the last decade, I have found myself not satisfied with what I have done
in this life.

I spent the first half of my life not using it well. During that time it is likely I took more time off my clock then I 
will be able to add back. This doesn't mean I am not going to try to live a better life, but I am not vain enough to 
think that I can exercise and eat my way to immortality.

### Conclusion 

 We need use today and every day we have left. We have been provided blessings in our lives that we should be using 
 every day. We **can** make ourselves satisfied using the blessings we have been given!
