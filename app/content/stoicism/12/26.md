    - quote:
        content: "It's not at all that we have too short a time to live, but that we squander a great deal of it. Life is long enough, and it's given in sufficient measure to do many great things if we spend it well. But when it's poured down the drain of luxury and neglect, when it's employed to no good end, were finally driven to see that it has passed by before we even recognized it passing. And so it is—we don’t receive a short life, we make it so."

We should work hard to finish this marathon we call life. To often we resemble a hamster spinning in a wheel. Once 
again, reminded on how we waste the one true blessing of ours… our time.

We could list all the statistics of how we as a specie waste our time on content such as social media, streaming audio 
and video content, on video games, etc. Technology is great, but my best guess is that technology has wasted more 
precious time than all other inventions combined.

We are blasted with media every day, so it is no wonder we consume so much content. The question is *"What do we have to
show for all the time spent watching?"* Other than some good banter around the water cooler, the real answer is
**"nothing"**.

The challenge going forward should be to let technology let us become more efficient with our time. Less time wasted 
scrolling through screen after screen and more time making our minds and bodies stronger.

### Conclusion

We need to put those things that waste our times away and focus on *living*. Our lives are plenty long, when we know 
how to use our time wisely.
