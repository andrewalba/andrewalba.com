On this day in 2020, I am grateful for my health and the health of my family. I appreciative to have a job that 
continues and compensates well. I am blessed to be loved by my dogs. I am blessed to have family.

I am grateful to be able to serve at my church. I am thankful to be able to help our dog rescue.

Gratitude can be infectious, as the radiant effects are positivity.

### Conclusion

What a great feeling to start off your day being **grateful**. Letting that feeling carry through from the moment we 
wake until we lay our head down to sleep at night. How awesome to allow that gratitude touch every part of our life!
