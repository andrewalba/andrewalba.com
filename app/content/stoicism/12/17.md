Today's lesson from :daily-stoic gave me pause. It is not difficult to find other people interesting. Maybe their 
life is more exciting than ours. Maybe their struggles are gossip worthy. For what ever reason we can be captivated by
the lives of others, but never even question our lives. 

What about our own lives? Do we feel they are interesting? Why do or would we feel our life is not important? Perhaps 
the answer is we don't ask the right questions of ourselves.

### Conclusion

Today we need to question: *Who am I? What is important to me? What do I like? What do I need?* It is time to explore 
ourselves. We should know our minds and body and as the authors state, "Before it's impossibly [too] late."
