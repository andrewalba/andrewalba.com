Our messages for December have us meditating upon mortality. This topic feels somber, gut wrenching, taboo. It is a 
subject young people don't give a second and older adults avoid. 

Personally, my struggles with mortality ebb and flow like waves on a beach. I find comfort through faith and then cringe 
about the philosophical impact of eternity.

What I am sure of right now is that mortality has become a subject I am more confident to talk about. While I have not 
completed the finishing touches to this life, they are in the works. 

{% daily_stoic %} provide a great example, to be like the soldier headed off to war. We want to let our intentions known 
in case we do not return, but we still intend on returning. It is a somber reminder that we should all share our plans 
with the ones we love in the event we are taken suddenly.
 
### Conclusion

Living your life like each day is like you last is not a mantra to be used to do what the flesh desires, but instead a 
reminder to get your life in order, so you can have comfort in knowing your life can end as you will it.
