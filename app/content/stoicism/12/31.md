Get busy with life's purpose, toss aside empty hopes, get active in your own rescue—if you care for yourself at all—and do it while you can."

Happy New Years Eve!

While the lesson is a conclusion to :daily-stoic, my journey does not end here. I will get to enjoy reading 
and studying Stoicism for another 10 months. This message is still fitting for a milestone such as the end of a 
year (*and oh what a year it has been*).

Looking forward to 2021 and our pursuit for the coming years should be to pursue a good life and death. We should be 
using our experience and wisdom to take actions.

words become works.

Studying the Stoics is just the beginning. Applying what we have learned into action should be the outcome.

### Conclusion

Our goal should be to move forward in becoming a better person each day. Calm our minds. Make reasoned choices. Use
the time we have left before death takes us. Don't wait for tomorrow, the time for action is **now**.
