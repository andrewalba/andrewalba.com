Today.

That is how the authors of :daily-stoic end the message for this date. *Today*. How often do we acknowledge 
something needs to start *today* only to decide later that we will start tomorrow. "I am going to begin eating 
healthy… starting tomorrow". "I am going to start going to the gym… next week". "I am going to be a better person… 
starting next year".

Maybe if we thought a little more about our mortality we would be starting these changes immediately. If we knew our 
death was imminent, would we wait until tomorrow to tell our family we loved them? If we knew our death was near, would 
we continue to focus on materialism?

### Conclusion

We are given this gift we call life, so accepting our mortality provides the freedom to use our gifts and make us the 
best people we can be.

Today!
