The opposite of death is life. Life is more than just *living*.

Why do we fear death? Is the answer because we need more hours to scroll through Facebook? Perhaps we are afraid we will 
not be able to keep toeing the line at a boring job? 

These examples hardly paint a picture of someone who is *living*.

### Conclusion

Seneca is reminding us that a life not full of living, is not much of a life at all. Adrenaline is not necessary to fill 
us with life. We don't have to go skydiving or bungee jumping to be living. Living could be something as simple as 
spending the day hiking a trail near your home. Putting in a few hours splitting wood. Spending twenty minutes with a 
pen and paper to record what you are grateful for.
