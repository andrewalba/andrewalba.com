How often do we give more weight to *important* people in life? Is a celebrity more important than your dentist? Is a 
Fortune 500 CEO more important than the person that cleans the CEO's office? Is a US president more important than any 
one of his constituents?

We should all know the answer is "no". It is too often in life, we end up trying to rationalize that certain higher 
profile people are more important in life. Death is proof that this is false. Death in many ways is the greatest 
equalizer for life.  

{% blockquote "Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,<br/>Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:<br/>
O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,<br/>Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw!", "Shakespeare" %}

### Conclusion

We would serve ourselves well to remember when we might be getting too pretentious or perhaps on the other end feeling 
inferior, we are all going to end up the same way. Death reminds us that none of us is better and none of us is worse. 
All of our storylines will finish the same… "The End".
