        content: "For it's disgraceful for an old person, or one in sight of old age, to have only the knowledge carried in their notebooks. Zeno said this … what do you say? Cleanthes said that … what do you say? How long will you be compelled by the claims of another? Take charge and stake your own claim-something posterity will carry in its notebook."

Quotes are meaningful. They are often the cream of the crop in regard to a topic. The best nuggets of wisdom.

It almost fills vain to believe we could create our own "quote worthy" notes. This is exactly what Seneca is encouraging 
us to do. This journey through Stoicism is leading towards a journal full of notes, but after the year is over, Seneca
would encourage us to create our own lessons and quotes.

### Conclusion

Consuming books, lectures and lessons can teach us so much. We should not neglect the value of our own experiences. It
is the combination of learning and life that gives us wisdom. Don't hesitate to put our thoughts and experiences down
as an example as well.
