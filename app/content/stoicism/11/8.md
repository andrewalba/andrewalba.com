      content: "Remember that you are an actor in a play, playing a character according to the will of the playwright—if a short play, then it’s short; if long, long. If he wishes you to play the beggar, play even that role well, just as you would if it were a cripple, a honcho, or an everyday person. For this is your duty, to perform well the character assigned you. That selection belongs to another."

It is interesting how today's reading marries well with the message heard at my church. The message at church was about 
thankfulness and being content. :daily-stoic reading for today is again about acceptance. 

When you merge the two messages together, they reinforce each other. I am reminded, too often I am **not** grateful 
for the blessings that I have been given. I may find myself **not** content with where my life is or where it appears to 
be going.

While I have the opportunity to make changes in my life, it is important to accept those life events that I cannot 
control and be thankful for where I am.

### Conclusion

Our role in life is not pre-destined, but sometimes we cannot control what our role will be. When we find ourselves in a 
position that is not welcomed, we can find happiness through acceptance and by being thankful for the good and the bad.
