Another reminder that our attitudes towards events in our lives shape the outcome more than the actual event.

The lesson provided in the :daily-stoic includes a reference to Malcolm Little who was sent to prison for his
crimes. While most of us could never imagine how we would handle such a sentence in life, my thoughts would be how I 
would handle the shame and isolation. Malcolm used the experience to gain an education, religion and motivation. He left
prison as Malcolm X and would devote his time to combat the struggle for civil rights.

The question is, did he suffer an evil? Most of us initially would say yes, but Malcolm chose to accept his fate and
turn the experience into a positive one. 

### Conclusion

Once again we are reminded that acceptance is not passive. Acceptance is just the first step towards improving the 
person you are.
