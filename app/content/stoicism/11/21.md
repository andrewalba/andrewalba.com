A refreshing thought that knowledge and wisdom are akin to enjoying a unique and significant moment. 

My wife and I have been watching the series [Long Way Up](https://www.longwayup.com/) and on a more recent episode one 
of the leads begins to get nostalgic as he reflects on how fortunate he is to experience his journeys with friends.

Having the blessing to be able to travel in the last decade, I know this feeling. So many moments that you want to 
seize and *keep the moment…forever*. 

### Conclusion 

Today might be the day we experience happiness or wisdom, but our reaction shouldn't be to live in the day forever. We 
should enjoy the moment. Study the sights, inhale the aromas, take time to just listen. Remember the sites, sounds and 
smells. You can keep those memories forever.
