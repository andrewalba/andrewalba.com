Today's reading was a good reminder that while we don't want to fight events in our lives, we need to remember to not
be resigned to always just accept what's done is done.

When life gives you a bowl of lemons, we have the opportunity to make lemonade. We can be dealt all types of hardships, 
but we can also find ways to navigate the circumstances to success.

### Conclusion 

Letting circumstances cripple us is similar to passively accepting fate. Adapting is another form of acceptance.
