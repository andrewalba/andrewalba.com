Today's reading has a real connection to some struggles I have been facing. Politics can always be a contentious subject 
and with the addition of technology and social media, I have found my blood boiling at times.

:daily-stoic has my solution. They quote Publilius Syrus *"Always shun that which makes you angry."* Sounds simple, 
but it only takes ten minutes on social media to ruin this plan. It takes a strength of will to accomplish. This is a 
goal worth achieving.

### Conclusion 

The ability to tune out the negative takes a strong will, but the result of your efforts will be peace and serenity.
