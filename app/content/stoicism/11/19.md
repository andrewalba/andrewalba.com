Epictetus referred to these three quotes within *Enchiridion, 53*. The three snippets subject matter revolves around 
tolerance, flexibility which eventually leads to acceptance.

What is an interesting take away from today's lesson is how :daily-stoic offers to apply this lesson to our daily 
life.

As a Christian, we have a belief in a higher power which helps us process this idea of acceptance. Applying this concept 
to everyday life can be made difficult as we are often *too close* to the problem. We are reminded to *zoom out* (even 
if just slightly), to be provided a different perspective.

### Conclusion

Take a moment to assume that every event that happens in our life, welcome or unwelcome, was intended to happen 
specifically for you. Without being able to know the outcome, but knowing there was intent, would you still want to 
fight against?
