If I was going to list out my worse attributes, being someone who complains a lot would be at the top of the list. When 
I was younger, I rationalized that if I had money, or a better job I wouldn't have a reason to complain. As the jobs 
and salaries improved, the complaining increased. 

What I have come to realize in the last few years is that complaining is blaming and not taking responsibility. What 
this lesson provides is some guidance on why I should just keep my mouth shut.

### Conclusion 

Adding the mantra of *"never complain, never explain"* to my growing list of phrases to remember. While complaining 
comes easy and may feel cathartic, the responsibilities are still mine, and the complaining never lightens the load.
