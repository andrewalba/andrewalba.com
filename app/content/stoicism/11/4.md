Such a well-timed message. As we approach election, we are facing the possibility of change. Such a wonderful message at 
this time. Change is not good or bad. As my wife would say, *"it is what it is"*. 

### Conclusion

The authors of :daily-stoic summarize this well. Events are objective, it is only our opinion that says something 
is good or bad. 

Our attitudes towards change and not the event that make it good or bad.
