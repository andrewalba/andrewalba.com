Life gives us what we want at times. We also get a fair share of what we don't want in life. The Stoics termed this 
*logos*. 

As a Christian, we believe that God blesses us in various ways, including with trials. It can be difficult to understand 
how a trial or tribulation can be a blessing.

The two views are similar. It is our acceptance (or refusal of acceptance) that shapes the outcome. 

### Conclusion 

We can cheerfully accept our blessings or ignorantly refute them, but in the end there is little difference between the 
two.
