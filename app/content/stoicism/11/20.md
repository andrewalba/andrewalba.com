Most of us want to believe our lives matter. We are special. We are unique. The truth is, we are none of this. While we 
might feel the events of 2020 are rare and unprecedented, this year is not any more unique than others years. The sun 
still rises in the east and sets in the west. We witness birth, and we witness death. We continue to breathe in and out.

When we think about this, we might become dejected, but as we are reminded in :daily-stoic we can take solace in 
the fact that this year is not special. No need to become apprehensive about what is to come. Just because we have never 
experienced something before, doesn't mean someone else has not. When we *zoom out* as in yesterdays message, we can
see events more clearly and find some peace.
