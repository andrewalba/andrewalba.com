Seven words. Two simple sentences. Mind blown!

The examples provided by :daily-stoic help to explain this further. Is a ship that has been preserved until every 
piece has been replaced, is it the same ship? A shrine that is rebuilt every twenty-three years. Is it one shrine that 
is over 1,400 years old or is it sixty consecutive shrines?

Today's reading once again points out that we live in a universe that is dynamic. No one can control everything that the 
universe throws at us, but we have the ability to weight the change as positive or negative based on our attitude.

### Conclusion 

Change can happen by design. Change can occur by circumstance. Moreover, change can be the result of happenstance. It is 
our attitude towards the change that gives the change weight.
