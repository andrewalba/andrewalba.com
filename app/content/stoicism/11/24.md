      content: "Whenever you experience the pangs of losing something, don't treat it like a part of yourself but as a breakable glass, so when it falls you will remember that and won't be troubled. So too, whenever you kiss your child, sibling, or friend, don't layer on top of the experience all the things you might wish, but hold them back and stop them, just as those who ride behind triumphant generals remind them they are mortal. In the same way, remind yourself that your precious one isn't one of your possessions, but something given for now, not foreverâ€¦"

Today's lesson deals with loss and how to deal with the fear of loss. Loss of income, home, status, friends or loved 
ones, life. 

The author of :daily-stoic tell us the history of when Roman generals would ride triumphantly, they had men riding 
behind whispering *"Remember, you are mortal"*. This didn't seem relevant to my life immediately, but we can apply this 
to our lives by remembering nothing lasts forever.

At some point we will all suffer loss. No matter how strong or invincible something feels, it is never eternal.

### Conclusion 

While we may never get over the fear of loss, we can soften the blow. We can learn to  recognize and accept we could 
lose something at any moment. This won't eliminate the feeling of loss, but should soften the jarring effects.
