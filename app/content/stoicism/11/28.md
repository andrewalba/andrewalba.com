The thought of pointing out the *flaws* of someone else feels sanctimonious and *un-Minnesotan*. Having thought on this 
for some time, I do believe it is important to give constructive criticism to a friend or family member you find 
struggling.

What is important to keep in mind is that you should not provide advice if you also struggle with the same faults. Which
leads me to believe the best way to help someone is to ask them to help you as well. If your friend is having an issue 
with always being late, ask them to help you avoid being late. If you have a family member who struggles with budgeting 
their money, ask them to help you budget your money. 

### Conclusion 

If we want to improve ourselves, we need to be open to constructive criticism. Truly wanting others to improve, we need 
to be willing to provide loving and sensitive criticism. If we have any struggles with that, then we need to learn to 
not be sensitive about the behavior in the first place.
