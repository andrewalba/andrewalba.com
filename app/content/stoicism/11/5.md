A large part of growing up is the realization that you are not the center of the universe (at least for me). My young 
adult life focused more on what gave me pleasure than what was healthy for me. This continued into my relationships and 
marriage. It wasn't until after the birth of my daughter that I came to realize how selfish I was.

I mention this because it was during this season of life that I put less priority on my faith. I was still a believer, 
but felt church and Bible study were not necessary. After all, I knew better than everyone, including God at times.

### Conclusion

Once you realize you are not the *director* of your life, you can accept the destiny that has been won for you. Giving 
up control can be liberating and make you life happier and easier.
