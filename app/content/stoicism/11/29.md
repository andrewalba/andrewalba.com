Today's lesson is something to always remember, but has special meaning after the elections of 2020.

If social media is a measurement, there are many that are feeling that: *All is lost. Everything is over now.* They are 
struggling with the fact that their candidate did not win. We should brace ourselves for some apocalyptic future.

Here is the truth. Four years ago this was the same sentiment, but for another group of people. While the last four 
years have been struggles for some, others have not witnessed the same struggles. The bottom line is that our country 
has experienced some suffering, but also some growing. The country and communities are still okay.

### Conclusion 

Even though life does not always happen as we think it should, we can know that we are going to be okay.
