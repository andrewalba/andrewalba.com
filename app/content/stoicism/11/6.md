  - quote:
      content: "If the breaking day sees someone proud, The ending day sees them brought low. No one should put too much trust in triumph, No one should give up hope of trials improving. Clotho mixes one with the other and stops Fortune from resting, spinning every fate around. No one has had so much divine favor That they could guarantee themselves tomorrow. God keeps our lives hurtling on, Spinning in a whirlwind."

This message is a roller coaster. We are reminded that good fortune becomes bad fortune and bad fortune becomes good 
fortune. 

Most of my life I have felt *unlucky*. Throughout my life I have seen people work hard and not be successful and seen 
others do little and succeed.

I have come to realize as I am getting older, that I am not unlucky as much as I have just made poor choices. I have 
worked hard, but my motive have been self-serving. Once I began to put the needs of others(my family) above my needs I 
began to see all the blessings that had been afforded me.   

### Conclusion

Life is a roller coaster of sorts. Good fortune becomes a curse, and a curse becomes a blessing. We can't control every 
event in our life, but our attitude towards life events can determine the ultimate outcome and our destiny.
