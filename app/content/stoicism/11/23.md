Reading the words of Epictetus, I only understood part of his message. When adding the comments from {% daily_stoic %} 
the message takes on even more significance.

Attachments can be comforting. It is only with experience that we learn that we can form unhealthy attachments. 
We should take a moment of pause and examine our attachments to the quality of people in our lives, attachments to 
fortune, reputation, occupation, and way of life. Why are they unhealthy? All of these attachments can change, and it is 
out of our control.

Everything can and will change. We can lose an attachment at anytime. Our ultimate recourse is our ability to make a 
*reasoned* choice.

### Conclusion 

While we can't control change, our choices allow us to be resilient. Our ability to make rational choices about a 
change can help easily accept and adapt the change.
