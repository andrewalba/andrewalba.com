This lesson is fascinating to me. When I think of how much time has passed since Marcus Aurelius wrote this, there is 
probably no point in time when some has read this and not felt it applicable to their current moment. 

History just continues to cycle, and we keep getting swept up with it. The current climate would have us believe that 
mankind has never been more ignorant. In reality, we continue to repeat the mistakes of our ancestors by ignoring the 
past.

People today would prefer to ignore facts and science just as they did thousands of years ago.

### Conclusion 

While we cannot expect others to accept what is true, we need to be steadfast with our habits as Stoics. 

<ol>
<li>Accept only what is true.</li>
<li>Work for the common good.</li>
<li>Match our needs and wants with what is in our control.</li>
<li>Embrace what nature has in store for us.</li>
</ol>
