  - quote:
      content: "Just as we commonly hear people say the doctor prescribed someone particular riding exercises, or ice baths, or walking without shoes, we should in the same way say that nature prescribed someone to be diseased, or disabled, or to suffer any kind of impairment. In the case of the doctor, prescribed means something ordered to help aid someone's healing. But in the case of nature, it means that what happens to each of us is ordered to help aid our destiny."

Garth Brooks had a popular song *"Unanswered Prayers"*. The song was about someone who reflects on how grateful they are
that their prayers went unanswered. In Christianity, we believe that God can test us. Sometimes these tests can feel 
like punishments, but in reality they are meant to strengthen our faith.

Marcus Aurelius is pointing out that nature provides us tests. These tests may cause sorrow, inflict pain and make us 
feel week. When we overcome these tests, we often find we have become wiser. Stronger. Some even are thankful for the 
pain. Stoicism welcomes these tests and would have us embrace them. Learn. Survive.

### Conclusion

While events of the day may not go our way, when we accept the bad with the good, we have an opportunity to become 
stronger. These tests have the ability to shape our destiny.
