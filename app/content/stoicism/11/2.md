      content: "But I haven't at any time been hindered in my will, nor forced against it. And how is this possible? I have bound up my choice to act with the will of God. God wills that I be sick, such is my will. He wills that I should choose something, so do I. He wills that I reach for something, or something be given to me - I wish for the same. What God doesn't will, I do not wish for."

Epictetus has *bound up [his] choice to act with the will of God*. This surrendering to a higher power provide some 
relief.

### Conclusion

We should do our best to plan. It is important to remember that even the best plans do not accomplish the outcome that 
we willed. Surrendering and accepting what has happened can be the first step to recovery.
