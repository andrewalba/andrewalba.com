My thoughts today are not directly related to the lesson, but have some relationship to the overall message. My thoughts 
related to the current political system. Political parties used to have a platform that they preached they would 
accomplish if elected. This no longer rings true. Political parties of this current era run with a platform that tells 
us of all the horrible things the *other* party plans.

I would find it refreshing if political parties took a more Stoic approach. An approach to reflect on what would make 
the individual party better. To work on their own faults. 

This is all a dream of course. As a society, we have decided that it is easier to point out the culpability of others 
then to think carefully about our own and how we can be better.

### Conclusion

We need to focus on making ourselves better. Once we have identified and corrected all of our faults 
**[and only then]**, we can feel free to start judging others.
