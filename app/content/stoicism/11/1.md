This message comes as we are about to elect a new president. Accepting  one candidate could win over the candidate I
have chosen feels like an incredible concession at this point. That is exactly what is needed if events unfold.

I learned through this lesson that Stoicism calls this *"the art of acquiescence"*. To accept rather than fight every 
little thing.

I also learned that Stoics took this even further by not only accepting what has happened, but to encourage us to enjoy 
what has happened.

### Conclusion

This is an incredible ask. Accepting something we do not favor that has happened can be difficult, but to try to 
encourage us to enjoy what has happened? No, to **love** what has happened? This can feel impossible, but is the fastest 
way to happiness and joy.
