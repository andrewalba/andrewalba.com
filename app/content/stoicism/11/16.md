What a fantastic read for today. When thinking of hope and fear, we often think of hope as a positive and fear as a 
negative. The Stoic Hecato of Rhodes pined that hope and fear are one of the same in the sense that they are projections 
into the future about things that we do not control.

As the authors of :daily-stoic eloquently state, *"Both are the enemy of this present moment that you are actually 
in."*

### Conclusion

Hope and fear are what we make them. Hope and fear can contain a large amount of *want*. The longer we continue to hope 
the more we begin to worry and this is where the danger lies.
