      content: "As for me, I would choose being sick over living in luxury, for being sick only harms the body, whereas luxury destroys both the body and the soul, causing weakness and incapacity in the body, and lack of control and cowardice in the soul. What's more, luxury breeds injustice because it also breeds greediness."

We hear stories about lottery winners whose lives are shattered after coming into good fortune. It is easy to 
rationalize that if I came into a fortune like this, everything would be different for me. 

Luxury does not provide happiness. At most luxury provides a false sense of comfort.

Finding happiness while struggling through life is a much easier feat if for no other reason, the bar has been set so 
much lower.

### Conclusion 

{% blockquote "Then Jesus said to his disciples, Truly I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the 
kingdom of heaven. Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is 
rich to enter the kingdom of God.", "Matthew 19:23-24" %}

I always enjoy this verse as it shows a sense of humor. It is also a powerful reminder of the dangers of riches and 
luxury. When we struggle, we can find the beauty and blessings in simpleness of life.
