The authors of :daily-stoic point out that Marcus borrowed from Heraclitus with this message. Heraclitus message 
was simple.

No man steps in the same river twice.

Heraclitus

The river and the man have both changed since their previous encounter.

This year is full of difficult times for many people around me. This year has had so much change in such a short time. 
Many assume (as I did) that this is *"the new way of things"*. In truth, this is just *"another way of things"* until 
the next way comes.

### Conclusion 

Everything is change. We have no choices on what the year 2020 has brought upon us. We do have a choice to welcome and 
roll with the changes.
