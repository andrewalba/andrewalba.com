    - quote:
        content: "For even peace itself will supply more reason for worry. Not even safe circumstances will bring you confidence once your mind has been shocked â€” once it gets in the habit of blind panic, it can't provide for its own safety. For it doesn't really avoid danger, it just runs away. Yet we are exposed to greater danger with our backs turned."

The authors of :daily-stoic provide us with some good references to the effects of prosperity. They cite an old 
proverb, "Money doesn't change people, it just makes them more of who they are."

### Conclusion

The authors point out that a Stoic would not wish for good fortune but instead wish for the strength of character that 
flourishes with prosperity.
