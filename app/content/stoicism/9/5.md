        content: "Remember, then, if you deem what is by nature slavish to be free, and what is not your own to be yours, you will be shackled and miserable, blaming both gods and other people. But if you deem as your own only what is yours, and what belongs to others as truly not yours, then no one will ever be able to coerce or to stop you, you will find no one to blame or accuse, you will do nothing against your will, you will have no enemy, no one will harm you, because no harm can affect you."

Our authors provide us an inspiring account of Captain James Stockdale. He prepared for his journey into enemy hands by 
being a pragmatist. He survived the ordeal by being resilient.

We are taught in the Christian faith to give to others who are less fortunate. For example, to assist a person 
struggling to get across a busy road.

### Conclusion

There are occasions where we serve others by helping ourselves first. For example, should we have an emergency on a 
plane, we need to put our oxygen mask first. To focus on our survival first, to serve and help others that are unable to 
help themselves.
