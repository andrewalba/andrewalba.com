        content: "Difficulties show a person's character. So when a challenge confronts you, remember that God is matching you with a younger sparring partner, as would a physical trainer. Why? Becoming an Olympian takes sweat! I think no one has a better challenge than yours, if only you would use it like an athlete would that younger sparring partner."

Having spent my formative athletic moments in a rural area, success in sports came effortlessly. It wasn't evident until 
later years, when competing with others in college, that it was apparent just how lacking I was in skills and talent.

This challenge from the competition was a bitter pill to swallow. It drove me to become a better athlete. In the end, 
the experience humbled me.

### Conclusion

How we handle challenges defines us. We may never find the ultimate success. It is our journey through these trials and 
tribulations that builds our character. It is that character that will allow us to succeed later.
