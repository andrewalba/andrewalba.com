We are stronger with preparation and practice. When we learn to endure, we learn to cope.

Wealth and health are great examples of preparation and practice. We should be saving enough of our money for an 
emergency. We should strive to be active and fit as we mature.

### Conclusion

Preparing and training make us better no matter what fate has in store for us. It makes us stronger and more agile in 
our daily lives.
