Spending any amount of time on special media, you will see the vast amount of hubris out and about our world. As if 
everyone is screaming, "Every man and woman for themselves!"

The *Karen's* of the world telling us we don't belong. People who are unwilling to love their neighbors but yet claim to
be Christian. Humility and empathy, missing.
