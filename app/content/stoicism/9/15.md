        content: "First practice not letting people know who you are — keep your philosophy to yourself for a bit. In just the manner that fruit is produced — the seed buried for a season, hidden, growing gradually so it may come to full maturity. But if the grain sprouts before the stalk is fully developed, it will never ripen &hellip; That is the kind of plant you are, displaying fruit too soon, and the winter will kill you."

We can learn Stoicism to impress our family and friends, but we would be missing the true purpose of Stoicism.

Our consumption of this knowledge should not be the end. Repeating this knowledge should not be the end. Finding ways to 
implement what we learn into our daily lives should be our goal.

### Conclusion

We grow by nurturing our learning and realizing our full potential. These acts will prepare us for success and failures 
in the days to come.
