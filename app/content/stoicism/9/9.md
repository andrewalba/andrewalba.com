We have been down this road before. Our fears cause us unnecessary misery. The fear of an unknown outcome can paralyze 
us and can be more damaging than the actual outcome.

::block-quote
let me assert my firm belief that the only thing we have to fear is fear itself -
nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which paralyses needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.

### Conclusion

We should avoid these needless stresses. We can not control fate, but we can control our choices and actions leading to 
it. We must resist the scrambling and dread that accompanies fear. It serves no purpose and only hinders our ability to 
turn the circumstances around.
