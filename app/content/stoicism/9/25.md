I could name a former Consul who is a slave to a little old woman, a millionaire who is the slave of the cleaning woman &helips; No servitude is more abject than the self-imposed."

A slave to our desires. Can you cope with a day without your cell phone? A week without your morning coffee? A month 
without an adult beverage?

It seems absurd to think that we would be without these things in our "first-world" lives. Cell phone service can go 
down. Doctors can suggest we remove caffeine or alcohol from our diets. They may seem like trivial losses, but how would 
you react?

### Conclusion

Seneca would suggest that we voluntarily give up items we desire. Put your phone down. Cut out coffee or alcohol for a 
week or a month. By making ourselves immune to our desires, we strengthen our resolve when what we desire is removed.
