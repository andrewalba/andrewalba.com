        content: "No one is crushed by Fortune, unless they are first deceived by her &hellip; those who aren't pompous in good times, don't have their bubbles burst with change. Against either circumstance, the stable person keeps their rational soul invincible, for it's precisely in the good times they prove their strength against adversity."

We often think of fortune in terms of money, but it can come in many forms. We can see riches in terms of finances, 
health, and family.

As a student of Stoicism, we would do well to remember that fortune can be fleeting. Financial markets crash without 
warning. Diseases can destroy the vitality of the most healthy. Families may suffer separation or death.

### Conclusion

We should consider our fortunes as borrowed. We can then mentally prepare for any loss and be grateful for our times of 
fortune.
