    - quote:
        content: "Remember that your ruling reason becomes unconquerable when it rallies and relies on itself, so that it won’t do anything contrary to its own will, even if its position is irrational. How much more unconquerable if its judgments are careful and made rationally? Therefore, the mind freed from passions is an impenetrable fortress—a person has no more secure place of refuge for all time."

We build habits throughout our life. Some of these habits are positive, while others are negative habits.

### Conclusion

So what do you want to be your habit? A habit of quick to anger or slow to anger? A mode of healthiness or gluttony? 
Make your choice, then begin the practice of repeating that habit over and over.
