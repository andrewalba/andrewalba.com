    - quote:
        content: "No, it is events that give rise to fear â€” when another has power over them or can prevent them, that person becomes able to inspire fear. How is the fortress destroyed? Not by iron or fire, but by judgments &hellip; here is where we must begin, and it is from this front that we must seize the fortress and throw out the tyrants."

Ponder everything that is outside our control. Our wealth, status, job, and our health are just a few to name. 
Stoicism also reminds us that we control our reasoned choices.

### Conclusion

Fear has the power to derail a reasoned choice. We can lock up because of fear.  We can become irrational. Don't betray 
the inner fortress that guards our soul.
