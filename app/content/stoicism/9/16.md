Watching others skate through life can grow frustrating. Some are born with a golden spoon and will never know of 
financial struggle. You may see others treat their bodies poorly and yet maintain their health. Life is not fair.

Perseverance is a quality designated to those who have riches, health, or fame.

### Conclusion

The difficulties of life can mold us into better people. Those challenges can allow us to be more empathetic and caring 
individuals. Overcoming those obstacles are what brings real greatness.
