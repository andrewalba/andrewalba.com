Taking time off can mean different things to different people. Taking time off for some people means being lazy all day. 
Sitting in the sun, relaxing with a drink, with every moment being slothful.

The Stoics would enjoy time off by being actively observant of the world around them. A window of time to read a book 
and to gain knowledge.

### Conclusion

When we retire, we should want more than to do nothing. We should aspire to keep active, to continue learning. Doing 
nothing is not living, and it is not liberty.
