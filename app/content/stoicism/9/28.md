    - quote:
        content: "How appropriate that the gods put under our control only the most powerful ability that governs all the rest — the ability to make the right use of external appearances — and that they didn't put anything else under our control. Was this simply because they weren't willing to give us more? I think if it had been possible they would have given us more, but it was impossible."

We can not control what other people think of us, just as we can not regulate the weather or our health. Our lack of 
control over these external factors does not leave us powerless.

### Conclusion

Our trump card resides in how we decide what these external factors mean. We determine what other people's thoughts 
about us mean, how the rain will affect our parade, how the doctor's findings apply to our life. Our decision is a just 
and pure form of control.
