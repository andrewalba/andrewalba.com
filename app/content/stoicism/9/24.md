    - quote:
        content: "Being unexpected adds to the weight of a disaster, and being a surprise has never failed to increase a person's pain. For that reason, nothing should ever be unexpected by us. Our minds should be sent out in advance to all things and we shouldn't just consider the normal course of things, but what could actually happen. For is there anything in life that Fortune won't knock off its high horse if it pleases her?"

When life is on cruise control, it can be difficult to imagine a reversal of fate. As a student of Stoicism, we should 
always be conscious of just a scenario.

### Conclusion

When the unthinkable happens, our preparedness allows us to accept what has come. From here we can move quickly to 
resolve.
