Our faiths teach us to pray often. We are not discouraged from praying for wealth, health, status, or beauty.

The contents of our prayers are often selfish. *Please, don't let my car break down. Please, don't let my loved one 
leave me. Please, let me win the lottery.*

### Conclusion

How wonderful is it that Marcus Aurelius reminds himself to pray differently? Instead of praying for spiritual 
intercession, he suggests we pray for fortitude, strength, or clarity. We may find our prayers answered more often.
