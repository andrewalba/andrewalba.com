A poetic reminder that we should learn to live with less.

What does less look like? It likely depends on what perspective you are sharing. If your life involves dining out at the
finest restaurants, having a home filled with expensive gadgets, and a closet full of designer clothes, you might find 
having less a real struggle. This is a pessimistic view for most.

A more optimistic view would be that the less is more. Less of those items above, means more freedom. Freedom from the 
social the pressure to "keep up with the neighbors", freedom from a distracting home, freedom to feel comfortable in 
your own skin.

Fate and fortune can run hot and cold. How prepared are we for earning less money, having less clout, or fewer 
resources? How equipped are we to handle less mobility, energy, and freedoms that come with age?

### Conclusion

If we are not already doing it, it is time to leave within our means now! Begin learning to live with less today. Learn 
to embrace *less is more*.
