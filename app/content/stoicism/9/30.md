Our bodies are physical and can fail us, but our minds can endure the pain and violence applied to our bodies.

### Conclusion

The outside world can inflict much harm, but we have the power within us to survive all kinds of adversity. We can 
remain philosophical. Our mind can be left untouched even when our body fails us.
