Our trials and tribulations can feel like a curse as we experience them. We may be unable to see the light at the end of 
the tunnel of our misfortune.

{% blockquote "What does not kill me makes me stronger.", "Nietzche" %}

Surviving these experiences makes us durable. These experiences are also opportunities to reflect on our true 
capabilities. They can empower us to try new or different adventures in the future.

### Conclusion

We would do well to remember that with every misfortune comes an opportunity to build up our strength and character. A 
hardship that we can appreciate later.
