Life is a dance is a common metaphor for life, but dancing is singular. Life involves external conflicts. Our authors 
suggest we use wrestling as a metaphor for life.

Having two sons who wrestled, this metaphor rings true for me. Wrestling requires strength, stamina, skill, and heart.

### Conclusion

In life, those requirements from wrestling can build a firm foundation. When we add philosophy to the mix, we can 
sharpen our will and strengthen our resolve.
