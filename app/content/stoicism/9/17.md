        content: "What if someone despises me? Let them see to it. But I will see to it that I won't be found doing or saying anything contemptible. What if someone hates me? Let them see to that. But I will see to it that I'm kind and good-natured to all, and prepared to show even the hater where they went wrong. Not in a critical way, or to show off my patience, but genuinely and usefully."

*Haters gonna hate*.

Our reaction to our haters matters more than the actions of those hating.

Is their opinion inside our control? Perhaps we can influence them to change their minds.

### Conclusion

What if their opinion of us is incorrect or unfair? We should accept their judgment with all of its flaws and move 
forward. We should also endure their conclusions without judgment in return.
