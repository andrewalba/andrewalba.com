As we mature, our *needs* mature. Grabbing coffee at the convenience store became a routine of picking up a large latte 
with a half shot of caramel at Caribou. We need to upgrade our vehicle, which happened to be your grandparent's old 
Chevy Citation.

As we achieve success, we forget how we ever survived on much less. But the truth is that we still found joy in those 
times we had less. We endured without wanting much more.

### Conclusion

Remembering what we had and where we came from can provide some peace. We should not be afraid to lose everything and 
start over. We have gotten by on much less, and we can continue to do so.
