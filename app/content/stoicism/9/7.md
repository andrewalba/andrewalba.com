Epictetus reveals that our hidden power is our own reasoned choice!

The stresses of work and family are a part of everyone's life. It is our reasoned choices that allow us to deal with 
hardships.

Do you want a promotion, or would you prefer more time in your week to enjoy camping? Would you like to fight with your 
spouse for leaving the toilet seat up/down all the time, or would you favor that time hiking a trail with them?

### Conclusion

It can be surprising how many little choices we make throughout a day can have a ripple effect on lives. Choose wisely 
and take advantage of the positives that result.
