    - quote:
        content: "Keep in mind that it isn't the one who has it in for you and takes a swipe that harms you, but rather the harm comes from your own belief about the abuse. So when someone arouses your anger, know that it's really your own opinion fueling it. Instead, make it your first response not to be carried away by such impressions, for with time and distance self-mastery is more easily achieved."

Perception is powerful. How we react to harmful acts puts us in absolute control.

Epictetus gives us the secret sauce on how to become masters to our control. Time and distance. Instead of getting 
carried away by our emotions, we should distance ourselves physically and mentally from harm. With time the harm will 
lose its sting.

### Conclusion

The ability to determine if an event or action is positive or negative is in our control through perception. Our 
perception will fuel our reactions. It is much easier to choose not to react when nothing is fueling our reactions.
