Flying off the handle. This is a familiar term to me. When younger, I would be quick with raw emotion to berate someone 
without any thought involved.

I was provided some advice, to resolve my hasty actions. Instead of reacting, put my thoughts into an email. Once 
completed, the email is saved to be sent the following day. This great advice resulted in few emails ever being sent.

### Conclusion

Not reacting to the drama in our lives can be difficult. We demand to make our case. Compelled to fight back. These 
*reactions* are often followed by **regret**.  We can choose to forego the instant gratification of rage. The outcome 
will result in lasting peace with no regret.
