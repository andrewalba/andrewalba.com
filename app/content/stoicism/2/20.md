Looking back on my life, I realize the detrimental effects of my desires and coveting. Money and or time spent with 
nothing positive to show in return. Resources wasted.

{% blockquote 'Ever wonder what God thinks of money? Just look at the people he gives it to.', 'Anne Lamott in "Bird by Bird"' %}

### Conclusion

Curbing one's desires can be challenging. As we ponder a possible indulgence, we should be asking, *"Is this pleasure 
worth our time or money"*? Pleasure does not equate to happiness. We can attain happiness by avoiding pleasure.
