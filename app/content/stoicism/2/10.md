        content: "There is no more stupefying thing than anger, nothing more bent on its own strength. If successful, none more arrogant, if foiled, none more insane â€” since it's not driven back by weariness even in defeat, when fortune removes its adversary it turns its teeth on itself."

Anger as motivation? Use your anger and antagonism to prove other's wrong? While this might provide an amount of 
incentive, sustaining success is impractical.

The side effects of that anger poison everything else around it. There is also a physical toll the fury will exert.

### Conclusion

Anger can be the fuel for your motivations, but this source of ammunition can be pernicious. Avoid using extreme 
emotions to power you towards goals.
