Why have I never thought about this before? Various situations can cause anxiety, anger, fear, excitement. The 
circumstances have no care about our feelings. So why do we continue to have emotions about chance?

### Conclusion

Chance has no empathy towards us, so our reaction towards an outcome is energy wasted. Our goal should be to eliminate 
our reaction towards circumstances, unattached towards any situation.
