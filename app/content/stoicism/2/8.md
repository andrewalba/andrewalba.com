Driving is a rare experience since COVID-19 measures have been in place.  Had you been a fly on the window of my truck 
prior, you would have been in for a treat. Curse words would storm from my mouth. Rude hand gestures made rare 
appearances. Reflecting now, I am beyond embarrassed for my actions.

Had someone called me out at the moment, "Is this making you feel better?" I undoubtedly would have been ashamed.

### Conclusion

If you find yourself freaking out, complaining of ailments or illness, moaning about the misfortunes of life, ask: *How 
is this making me feel better? Will these reactions change anything?*
