    - quote:
        content: "Keep this thought handy when you feel a fit of rage coming on — it isn't manly to be enraged. Rather, gentleness and civility are more human, and therefore manlier. A real man doesn't give way to anger and discontent, and such a person has strength, courage, and endurance — unlike the angry and complaining. The nearer a man comes to a calm mind, the closer he is to strength."
        author: Marcus Aurelius

Words meant to inflict hurt on others. Bursts of rage. Outbursts aimed towards others. These behaviors may not reflect 
the person you are but do mirror who you are at the moment.

### Conclusion

There is strength in being steady. Being persistent in your quest for tranquility will be rewarding. Stoicism is to be 
in control of your emotions instead of being controlled by your emotion.
