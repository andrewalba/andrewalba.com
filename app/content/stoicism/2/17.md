If only I lost weight, my life would be better. If I earned a larger salary, I would be happy with life. Today I learned 
there is a term for this type of thinking. Psychologists call this *"conditional happiness."*

### Conclusion

It never occurred to me that this type of thinking affects our chances for happiness at the moment. Yearning for 
something to come, we lose sight of anything that may provide us enjoyment now. Our choice is to put energy towards 
happiness that may never occur or be happy now with what we have now.
