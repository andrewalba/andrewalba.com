Passion. Passionate about learning, politics, adventure, and life. Having an abundance of zeal felt like a positive 
aspect of my life and was worn like a badge of honor.

To use passion assertively, we need to be in control. For almost five decades, there has been little control over my 
emotions towards my enthusiasm.

### Conclusion

Pure passion without control can lead to a storm that builds and becomes destructive. Having a plan can help you 
navigate a growing gale. A reasoned approach can prepare you for the dangers of passion and help you navigate the 
potential threats in a novel manner.
