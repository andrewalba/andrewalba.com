This lesson would have served many of us well in 2020 and the election. Volleying of differing opinions, back and forth. 
Blood would boil before the morning coffee was finished.

Marcus Aurelius reminds us to not let opinions upset our state of mind. We don't have to hate or like any candidate. We 
don't have to support or obstruct a political party. We don't have to have an opinion.

### Conclusion

Going about life without an opinion will be difficult for someone who has had an opinion about **everything** for almost 
half a century. How gratifying to not have to have a thought towards a subject. No effort. No argument. How powerful to 
let a topic become trivial.
