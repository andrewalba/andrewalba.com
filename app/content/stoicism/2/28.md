    - quote:
        content: "The soul is like a bowl of water, and our impressions are like the ray of light falling upon the water. When the water is troubled, it appears that the light itself is moved too, but it isn't. So, when a person loses their composure it isn't their skills and virtues that are troubled, but the spirit in which they exist, and when that spirit calms down so do those things."

Even with the best intentions, we are bound to make mistakes. Our failures need not define us. Our reactions to failures 
are what define us.

### Conclusion

Mistakes can control us when our emotions follow unchecked. In those turbulent moments, we need to stop and take a 
breath. Use reason to restore control.
