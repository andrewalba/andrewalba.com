*Prohairesis*. Our moral choice. Our reasoned choice. In modern society, a stoic is someone who lacks emotions. True 
Stoicism is not about being emotionless. There are many references that one of the greatest Stoics Marcus Aurelius wept 
on occasions. Stoicism is about using your reasoned choice to guide you.

### Conclusion

Many times emotions can cloud our reason. *Prohairesis* allows us to develop a persona of invincibility. Our response is 
neither too little nor too much but balanced based on reasoned choice.
