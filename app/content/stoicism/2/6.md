When I initially reflected on this lesson in :daily-stoic, I didn't feel this applied to me as much as it does to 
others I know. My compulsions would not seem to fit the narrative.

Then I realized that Seneca is citing anyone driven by a compulsion (me) and not just habitual offenders. Anyone who has 
decided to plunge into some work that is chaotic without an exit plan.

### Conclusion

It can be admirable to dive into the chaos at work or home with the intention of restoring order. We should not be 
afraid of hard work and sacrifice. We must have a reasoned plan though. With an end goal, we can endure the turbulent 
struggles. If a deliberate plan of attack is not available to us, we should instead choose peace.
