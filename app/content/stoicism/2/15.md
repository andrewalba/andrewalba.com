How much energy has been wasted on one's life, fearing that which never comes? Our strength is sapped in rage as well.

Fear, anxiety, and anger frequently are a product of our imagination. Reality escapes us further as the emotions swell. 
When this happens, we should ask *Are these rational thoughts?*

### Conclusion

We do not question irrational thoughts while dreaming. Getting upset or anxious is similar to continuing a dream while 
being awake. What aggravated us was pseudo, but our reactions were undeniable.
