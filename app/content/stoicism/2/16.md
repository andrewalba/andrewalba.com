    - quote:
        content: "If someone asks you how to write your name, would you bark out each letter? And if they get angry, would you then return the anger? Wouldn't you rather gently spell out each letter for them? So then, remember in life that your duties are the sum of individual acts. Pay attention to each of these as you do your duty&hellip; just methodically complete your task."

P: Would you mind finding a place for these tools on the kitchen counter today?

Me: Seriously? You have dirty dishes in the living room, hair products all over the bathroom vanity, clothes scattered 
everywhere in the bedroom. Are you seriously complaining about my tools on the counter? No, I won't stand for this.

A scenario like this has played out multiple times in my life. While I feel justified at the time, the truth is my 
reactions only make things worse. Emotions fuel a conversation to an argument. Was my time spent well?

### Conclusion

There is enough difficulty in our lives (and jobs) already. Letting trivial matters trigger emotional outbursts 
multiplies the hardship. Completing the simple task not only is the efficient path but the direction to virtue.
