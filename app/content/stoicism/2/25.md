Marcus Aurelius is providing us a simple reminder to keep our passions in check. In his journal, he reminds himself that 
even the greatest before him are soon to be forgotten.

### Conclusion

If our quest to be the best of what we are drives us to scorn, rage, mania, or pettiness, then we have failed and become 
victims of our passion. Why spend precious time on this earth enslaved to negative emotions. We should enjoy our time, 
for our time on this earth is short, and our memories will soon be forgotten.
