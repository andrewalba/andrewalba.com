This quote from Seneca takes on so much more when you look at his history. He tutored the young Nero. After Nero became 
ruler of Rome, Seneca worked to reign in the behaviors of Nero. Nero abused his powers and killed anyone who might 
become a threat, including Seneca.

Fear has a snowball effect that can cause us to become irrational. Decisions made in haste without reasoned thought can 
lead us to a fate worse than our initial fear.

### Conclusion

Don't let fear lead to misfortune. To conquer fear, we start by controlling our impulses. With control of our feelings, 
we can begin to reason and judge with clarity.
