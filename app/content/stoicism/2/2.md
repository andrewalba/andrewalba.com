Marcus Aurelius is referring to our impulses and not letting them enslave us any longer. These can be challenging 
behaviors to address as we can *mindlessly* act on impulses. We may not even recognize we responded on an impulse until 
much later.

We can examine what desires and judgment can assist us in handling our impulses. Have impulses to eat junk food? Don't 
purchase junk food. Your impetus is to shop? Put a note on your credit card that challenges you, "do you need this?". 

### Conclusion

While impulses may be subconscious actions, we can free ourselves from these forces by taking control. We can take 
control of actions and emotions and free ourselves from being puppets to our impulses.
