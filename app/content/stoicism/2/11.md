        content: "Our soul is sometimes a king, and sometimes a tyrant. A king, by attending to what is honorable, protects the good health of the body in its care, and gives it no base or sordid command. But an uncontrolled, desire-fueled, over-indulged soul is turned from a king into that most feared and detested thing â€” a tyrant."

We often associate a rise in power with a penchant for corruption.

::block-quote
Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men.

#author
Lord Acton 1887
::

Look at the corrupting influence of the Roman emperors.  Some rulers went as far as declaring themselves gods. Yet the 
Romans would also provide the world with a philosopher-king.

### Conclusion

Absolute power may corrupt, but not absolutely. The extent of the corruption depends upon the strength and morals of the 
individual. While we may not have complete authority, we do have a choice in both our personal and professional lives. 
Tyrant or a father. A patient leader or evil emperor. Nobel confidante or fierce adversary. Which do we choose?
