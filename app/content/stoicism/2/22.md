        content: "Cato practiced the kind of public speech capable of moving the masses, believing proper political philosophy takes care like any great city to maintain the warlike element. But he was never seen practicing in front of others, and no one ever heard him rehearse a speech. When he was told that people blamed him for his silence, he replied, 'Better they not blame my life. I begin to speak only when I'm certain what I'll say isn't better left unsaid."

To have the patience, honesty, and confidence of Cato.

Stoic philosophy is relatively new to me, but listening more and talking less is something I have been working on in the 
last few years. Listening has come easy and is enjoyable. Finding the correct words when speaking has been incredibly 
difficult (and increasingly difficult by the day).

### Conclusion

Learning to select and utter the most efficient sentences is a skill that requires patience, thoughtfulness, honesty, 
knowledge, and confidence. The words omitted are as meaningful as those words spoken. One day, it is my sincere desire 
that I can master this talent.
