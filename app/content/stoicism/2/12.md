Studying Stoicism can provide us with tools to manage those moments of frustration and stress in our life. It is 
relevant to consider that these tools will not eliminate an endless parade of problems.

It is an important distinction to make. If your life has become a never-ending series of discouraging moments and 
annoyance, you may need to examine more.

### Conclusion

We can lose a small piece of ourselves when we find our blood pressure rising. Remember to ask yourself *is this the 
job/life I genuinely want?* Our life (and sanity) is a precious resource, and we must not be afraid to make a change 
when necessary.
