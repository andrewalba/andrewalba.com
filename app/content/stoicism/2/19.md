    - quote:
        content: "Remember to conduct yourself in life as if at a banquet. As something being passed around comes to you, reach out your hand and take a moderate helping. Does it pass you by? Don't stop it. It hasn't yet come? Don’t burn in desire for it, but wait until it arrives in front of you. Act this way with children, a spouse, toward position, with wealth — one day it will make you worthy of a banquet with the gods."

The metaphor Epictetus provides us with the banquet can be interpreted in many ways. Patience. Modesty. Gratitude. 
Selflessness. Charity. Enjoying the moment.

### Conclusion

We display modesty and patience by waiting for our turn. Acknowledging the opportunity to feast at the banquet, we 
exhibit gratitude. Taking our time to enjoy the meal and company, we are present in enjoying the moment. To be gracious 
and help the host clean up shows selflessness. To use the experience to return the favor and host a banquet displaying 
charity.
