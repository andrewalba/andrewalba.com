We all have bouts with anxiety. Some people may manifest their anxiousness in a manner visible to those around them. 
Others struggle internally. Epictetus is reminding us that both forms of fear start by wanting something out of our 
control.

Anxiety can be difficult for many to handle as they struggle with yielding control of what is not theirs to command. 
Many can recognize those things out of their control but strain with relinquishing that control.

### Conclusion

When we find ourselves feeling as if our *insides have become coiled into knots*, it is meaningful to ask why? Take a 
few deep breaths and ask who is in control at that moment, you or your anxiety? Most importantly, *is my anxiety 
resolving anything*?
