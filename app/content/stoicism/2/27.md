        content: "Of all the things that are, some are good, others bad, and yet others indifferent. The good are virtues and all that share in them; the bad are the vices and all that indulge them; the indifferent lie in between virtue and vice and include wealth, health, life, death, pleasure, and pain."

While a life without sin is not obtainable, the pursuit of such a life provides exponential benefits. Imagine enjoying a 
life that has no hate, no need to gossip, and does not covet. What effect could this have on our relationships with 
family and friends?

### Conclusion

When we do not care about the material lives of our neighbors, we can be objective about our own goals. Our goal should 
not be avoiding vices, but instead not give corruption more power than it deserves.
