American culture teaches us that with hard work "we can have it all". Modern America has provided us the means to not 
only have it all but have it all instantly. Missing are lessons in patience and contentment.

We are rarely reminded to ask *Do I need this or do I want this? What are the consequences if I don't get this? Am I 
able to survive without this?*

### Conclusion

The objective answer to those questions will often be **NO**. This will result in the loss of immediate pleasure. 
Happiness will be attained when we answer yes to all of those questions.
